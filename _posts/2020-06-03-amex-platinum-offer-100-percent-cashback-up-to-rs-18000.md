### Bottomline

This is a wonderful offer without too many terms and conditions attached to it. Moreover you can enjoy double dip using this offer along with [Amex Double Rewards Offer](/amex-double-rewards-offer-2x-points-2x-value-on-amex-platinum-card/){:target="\_blank"} getting a reward rate even higher than 100%.

For example, let's say if you spend Rs. 18,000 on Flipkart, you will get cashback of Rs. 18,000. Plus you will get 900 reward points. If you redeem those reward points using "Select & Redeem", you will get a value of Rs. 450. So overall on spending Rs. 18,000, you are getting Rs. 18,450 back which is 102.5%. Amazing, isn't it?

This offer is really aggressive and Amex is trying to retain as many Amex Platinum Card Members as they can. Cards like Amex Platinum shine in the travel segment and travel is going to be restricted for at least a year due to COVID-19. This offer will certainly persuade the Amex Platinum Card Members to renew the card as they would be recovering a part of annual fees utilizing this offer. I expect more fabulous offers on Amex Platinum Card during the festive season.

I hope Amex will roll out similar offers on other lower segment cards too. I'm keeping my fingers crossed!
