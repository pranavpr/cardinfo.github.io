Visa is promoting contactless transactions aggressively these days and it has partnered with Kotak to offer [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) vouchers on credit and debit card spends. Visa has brought the contactless offers in partnership with [HDFC](/earn-2x-reward-points-5-cashback-on-hdfc-visa-contactless-transactions/) & [SBI](/10-cashback-on-contactless-transactions-with-visa-sbi-credit-cards/) in the past too. Those who are not aware, a transaction of up to Rs. 2,000 can be made by tapping on contactless enabled POS terminals without entering the PIN.

### Bottomline

I'm always hesitant about the offers based on top spenders criteria, mainly because there is no transparency. There is no realtime dashboard to see if you're in the list of top spenders or not. I wish, Kotak should have structured this offer based on minimum spending criteria just like [HDFC](/earn-2x-reward-points-5-cashback-on-hdfc-visa-contactless-transactions/) & [SBI](/10-cashback-on-contactless-transactions-with-visa-sbi-credit-cards/). Solely due to this reason, I feel this offer is not so great. However if you have a Kotak card which you already use for daily transactions, make sure you do those transactions in contactless mode instead of Chip & PIN.
