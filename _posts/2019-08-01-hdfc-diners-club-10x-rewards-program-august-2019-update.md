[Myntra](https://l.cardinfo.in/myntra), PayZapp, Zoomcar & Godrej Nature’s Basket are new additions to this program and Uber, [TataCLIQ](https://l.cardinfo.in/tatacliq), [BigBasket](https://l.cardinfo.in/bigbasket), SOTC & Furlenco have been removed. Also note that this offer in addition to [SmartBuy 10X Rewards Program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-july-2019-update/) which has also been extended till 31 August 2019.

Addition of PayZapp to 10X program is certainly a welcome move as it can be used to pay utility bills and rent. Also it can be used for payment on other websites also which have PayZapp as payment method enabled e.g. [BigBasket](https://l.cardinfo.in/bigbasket), [MakeMyTrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/makemytrip), Yatra, PVR, [Domino's](https://l.cardinfo.in/dominos), [Pizza Hut](https://l.cardinfo.in/pizzahut), KFC etc. Removal of Uber, Tata Cliq and BigBasket with no equivalent replacement is certainly disappointing. However the best news is 10X program is going to continue for next five months with it's unmatched reward rate. So make best use of this program while it lasts.
