All set for your dream foreign vacation, but worried about your spends on credit cards due to high foreign currency markup fees? Worry no more as in this article, I am listing best credit cards with low foreign currency markup available in India.

Those who are not aware, if you spend in currency other than Indian Rupees, banks charge you a foreign currency mark up fee. This fee is as high as 3.5% + GST (~4.13%) for some credit cards. It means, if you spend Rs. 1 Lakh in foreign currency, you end up paying close to Rs. 4,130 just as foreign currency markup fees which quite a significant amount.

<sup>*</sup> Maximum Reward Rate

Though you can rely on credit cards, I would still suggest to carry some foreign currency with you for emergency situations. Also always choose to pay in local currency instead of on the fly conversion to INR at point of sales terminal. Though on the fly conversion gives you a piece of mind by showing exact amount you're spending in INR, it generally adds extra charges.
