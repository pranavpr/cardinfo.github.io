Citi Bank has rolled out an offer on their credit cards wherein they are providing cashback on recharging the Paytm wallet via Citi app/website. This offer is similar to the [offer](/citi-credit-card-bill-payment-paytm-wallet-recharge-offer/#paytm-wallet-recharge){:target="\_blank"} which Citi ran in previous quarter. Let's look into the details to know more.

### Offer Details

- **Offer:** Flat Rs. 100 cashback on Paytm wallet recharge done via Citi app/website
- **Minimum Transaction:** Rs. 1,500
- **Period:** 5 June 2020 to 19 June 2020
- **Type**: Available on all Citi Credit Cards
- **Excluded Cards:** Citi Corporate Cards
- **Fulfillment:** Cashback amount will be credited on or before 90 business days from the date of transaction
- **Source:** Email, [Website](https://www.online.citibank.co.in/special-offers/offer/index.html?cat=New_Offers&id=126&eOfferCode=NPRYWKM6MLR){:target="\_blank"}

One thing to note about this offer is that add on cards will be treated as separate cards. Hence you can use all your add-on cards to maximize the benefit. Also Paytm First Credit Card is not excluded from this offer unlike last time which is a good news.

### Bottomline

This is a great offer from Citi Bank and translates to a reward rate of 6.67% which is quite good. Most banks generally don't provide reward points on wallet recharge. However Citi is defying the norm and providing bonus cashback on wallet recharge which is amazing. I would highly recommend to utilize this offer if you are a Citi Card holder.

_I have already utilized this offer on my Citi Card. What about you? Let me know in comments below._
