HSBC has come up with a spend based offer for targeted segment of customers. This offer entitles card holders to get [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) voucher of Rs. 500 on spending Rs. 3,000 on dining, telecom and fuel.

This is a quite lucrative offer as it gives back as high as 16.67% in form of [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) vouchers. Only downside is HSBC uses Merchant Category Codes (MCC) issued by Visa/MasterCard for determining the categories. Since MCC is not revealed by merchants, you can never be sure if your spending across all three categories to qualify for this offer.
