### Bottomline

I received a spend target of Rs. 5,000 to earn 1,000 reward points on my Amex Gold Charge Card which I don't use frequently. Most of my spending has shifted to [HDFC Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-upgrade-experience/){:target="\_blank"} which offers a default reward rate of 3.3%.

This is a really great opportunity to earn bonus membership reward points. It's exciting to note that both these offers can be stacked to get the maximum benefit. Amex has been really aggressive in pushing out targeted offers to their card members these days which is quite awesome.
