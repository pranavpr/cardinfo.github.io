811 #DreamDifferent Credit Card sports a watercolor painting on the card face which makes it stand out from the crowd. The minimalist design is quite decent, however lacks premium looks. The card is available on Visa Platinum platform and is enabled for contactless transactions.

### Eligibility Criteria

811 #DreamDifferent Credit Card is an entry level secured credit card.

- Age: 18 to 75 Years
- Fixed Deposit Amount: Rs. 15,000

Generally up to 80% of fixed deposit amount is provided as the credit limit. You would be told the credit limit upfront at the time of applying for the card. You should be able to apply for this card on 811 Mobile App or [Website](https://www.kotak.com/en/personal-banking/cards/credit-cards/apply-for-kotak-bank-credit-card.html?pid=811card&utm_source=cardinfo.in){:target="\_blank"}.

It's evident that this card is targeted towards those who don't have credit history and want to build one.

### Fees

- Joining Fee: Nil
- Annual Fee: Nil

811 #DreamDifferent Credit Card comes no joining and renewal fee which is amazing.

### Features

811 #DreamDifferent Credit Card being an entry level card, the features and benefits are little limited. Let's look into the different features to know more.

#### Activation Offer

- 500 bonus reward points on activation and Rs. 5,000 spends in the first 45 days of card set up

This means you get Rs. 125 on activating the card and spending just Rs. 5,000 which is great.

#### Reward Points

- 2 reward points on spending Rs. 100 online, 0.50% reward rate
- 1 reward points on spending Rs. 100 offline, 0.25% reward rate

0.50% reward rate on online spends and 0.25% reward rate on offline spends appear to be on the lower side. This is the most disheartening feature of this credit card and I wish Kotak should have provided a better reward rate.

#### Milestone Benefits

On spending Rs. 75,000 in a year, you are eligible for one of the following rewards:

- Rs. 750 cashback
- 4 PVR movie tickets, ~Rs. 1,000

This is an additional ~1% reward rate which makes the overall reward rate as 1.25%-1.50% which is quite decent. However, the overall reward rate diminishes if you spend more than Rs. 75,000 annually.

#### Other Benefits

- 1% Fuel Surcharge waiver for transactions between Rs. 500 and Rs. 3,000, capped to Rs. 3,500 per year
- Railway Surcharge waiver, capped to Rs. 500 per year
  - 1.8% on IRCTC portal
  - 2.5% at Indian railway booking counters

Surcharge waivers for fuel and railway tickets are decent.

### Bottomline

811 #DreamDifferent Credit Card is a decent entry level credit card for those who want to build their credit history and are looking for a secured credit card. A reward rate of ~1.25%-1.50% on annual spends of Rs. 75,000 is pretty decent. This card would certainly make its spot in the list of [best credit cards against Fixed Deposit in India](/best-credit-cards-against-fixed-deposit-in-india-for-2019/#9-kotak-aqua-gold-credit-card){:target="\_blank"}.

Note that Kotak has rebranded the Kotak Aqua Gold Credit Card to 811 #DreamDifferent Credit Card starting 15 July 2020. Hence if you are holding a Kotak Aqua Gold Credit Card, you should start getting benefits outlined in this article.
