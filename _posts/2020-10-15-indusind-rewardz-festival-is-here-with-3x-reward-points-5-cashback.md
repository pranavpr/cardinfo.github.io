### Bottomline

I received Spend Level 1 of Rs. 60,000 and Spend Level 2 of Rs. 1.2 Lakhs on my [IndusInd Iconia Amex Credit Card](/indusind-iconia-american-express-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} which is quite high I believe. The maximum bonus reward points I can earn using this program is 2,500. Using this offer, I can get a reward rate of 4% on weekend online spends on my Iconia Amex Card on spending upto Rs. 1,20,000 which is decent.

The 5% cashback partner list is really underwhelming. I wish IndusInd should have included major e-commerce partners like Amazon, Flipkart etc. to attract masses.

I would discourage you from utilizing the third offer of converting the outstanding to EMI as you'll lose more on interest than gaining through cashback.
