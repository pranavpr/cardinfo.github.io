Yes Bank recently launched [Yes Cart](/yes-bank-launches-yes-cart-a-compare-and-buy-portal-for-yes-bank-cards/), a compare and buy portal similar to SmartBuy. To tap the festive spends on major e-commerce sites, Yes Bank has unveiled the 10X reward program today. Under this program, Yes Bank Credit Card holders can enjoy 10X bonus reward points by shopping on [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart), [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon), [Myntra](https://l.cardinfo.in/myntra) and [TataCLIQ](https://l.cardinfo.in/tatacliq) using Yes Cart.

### Bottomline

Yes Bank is trying to mimic the [10X rewards program of HDFC SmartBuy](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-rewards-even-more-rewarding-with-december-2019-update/), however due to lower base reward rate on it's premium credit cards, HDFC Bank's offer beats it down. Still, this a really good offer and [Yes First Exclusive Credit Card](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/) holders can enjoy a handsome reward rate of 15%. Similarly, Yes First Preferred Card members can enjoy a reward rate of 10% which is quite good. Only downside of this offer is maximum cap of 10,000 on reward points, which I believe is quite less.
