HSBC has come up with spend based targeted offer on it's credit cards wherein cardholders will get 10% cashback on all spends, subject to a cap of Rs. 500. This offers comes just after [Citi's](/citi-credit-cards-spend-based-targeted-offer-august-2019/) & [SBI's](/sbi-card-targeted-spend-based-offer-july-2019/) spend based targeted offer and it seems all card issuers are trying hard to increase their active user base.

## Offer Details

- **Maximum Cashback**: Rs. 500
- **Period**: 1 August 2019 to 30 September 2019
- **Minimum Spends**: Rs. 3,000
- **Minimum Transactions**: 3
- **Exclusions**: Transactions that are cancelled or reversed during the Offer Period
- **Type**: Targeted, not valid if communication not received

- **Source**: [Email](http://mail.hsbc.com.hk/in/cc_drmnt_segc2_0819/offer.htm)

This offer provides a reward rate of 10% which is quite awesome. However the maximum cap of Rs. 500 is little disappointing.
