### Bottomline

This offer is a decent offer and will allow you to earn bonus reward points on online spends. Below tables summarizes the reward rate on Yes First Credit Cards:

<sup>\*</sup> Utilizing this offer
 
Though the reward rate looks decent, the maximum bonus reward point you can earn is just 1,000 which is disappointing. You would be able to hit the maximum cap of reward points by spending Rs. 5556 on Yes First Exclusive and Rs. 8,333 on Yes First Preferred in Travel & Dining category. Also keep in mind that the above reward rate is valid only for redemption in the travel category. If you redeem the reward points for other options, the value of 1 reward point will decrease from Rs. 0.25 to Rs. 0.15.
 
This offer is just an offer for namesake and I don't see much value in this. To make it lucrative, Yes Bank should have given a better bonus reward rate (like 5X or 10X) as well as a better maximum cap. In this current form, I am not going to utilize this offer.
