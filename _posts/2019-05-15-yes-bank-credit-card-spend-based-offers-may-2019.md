Yes Bank is back with their spend based targeted offers wherein you'll get Amazon vouchers on meeting the target. It seems, many people stopped using Yes Bank credit cards after [Yes Bank devalued their cards](/yes-bank-credit-cards-rewards-reduced/) last month. Hence Yes Bank is trying to increase the volume of transactions using these kind of spend based offers.

### Offer Details

- **Excluded Transactions:** Cash withdrawals done on Yes Bank Credit Card

- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.yesbank.in/pdf/terms_conditions_amazon_voucher_on_credit_card_spends_may19_pdf)

I received following targets over SMS followed by an e-mail:

<table class="table" style="display: block;overflow-x: auto;">
<thead class="thead-dark">
<tr>
	<th scope="col"> Net Spends Target</th>
	<th scope="col"> Amazon e-Voucher</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td> Rs. 70,000 </td>
	<td> Rs. 3,500 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td> Rs. 60,000 </td>
	<td> Rs. 1,500 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This offer translates to a reward rate of 5% for Rs. 70,000 target and 2.5% for Rs. 60,000 target over and above existing rewards.
