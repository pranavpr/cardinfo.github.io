HDFC Bank has come up with yet another exciting offer wherein they're providing 10X reward points on their credit cards for all Uber Premier rides.

- **Fulfillment**: Additional 9X reward points will be posted after 90 days from the last date of the transaction month

HDFC Bank has not yet disclosed the maximum reward points one can accumulate using this offer, however they did mention that it's dependent on credit card variant.

### Bottomline

HDFC has been on roll recently and after [Netflix](/hdfc-netflix-offer-3-months-netflix-free-with-hdfc-bank-credit-cards/) offer, this is yet another fantastic offer from them. HDFC Infinia and Diners Club Black card members can get a value back of 33% on their cards. HDFC Regalia and Diners ClubMiles can enjoy a decent reward rate of 13% using this offer. However, I wish, HDFC Bank should have made this offer available for all categories of Uber, not just Premier.
