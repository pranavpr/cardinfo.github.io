### Bottomline

This offer translates to a reward rate of **2.8%** if you're able to spend Rs. 2,50,000, which is decent. And if you are lucky enough to be in top 5 spenders list, the [MakeMyTrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/makemytrip) gift card of Rs. 1 Lakh will sweeten the deal further. However the problem with this is, there is no perfect way to know your position in spenders' list. Unless HSBC provides a transparent way to know one's position in spenders' list, I wouldn't even consider this.
