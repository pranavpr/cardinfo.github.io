Club Vistara SBI Card PRIME is a premium version of this card with higher fees and better benefits. The design of this card is similar to previous ones and golden murals on blue background looks pleasing to the eyes. Let's delve in to the details of the benefits offered by this card.

#### Welcome Benefits

- 1 Premium Economy ticket E-Gift Voucher (base fare waived off) on payment of annual fee

It's quite evident that SBI Card compensates for joining fees by providing the premium economy ticket.

Similar to previous card, spend on fuels also accrue reward points on this card which is great.

Again, the insurance cover provided by this card is comprehensive and limits are better than regular version.

### Bottomline

Club Vistara SBI Card is a nice attempt to attract those who like to earn air miles spends on their credit cards. Club Vistara SBI Card PRIME is in same league as Axis Bank Vistara Signature Credit Card fees wise, but former provides way better rewards than latter. It does makes sense to go for Club Vistara SBI Card PRIME instead of Axis Bank Vistara Signature Credit Card.

{% include tip.html tip="You may need to cancel your existing co-branded credit card from SBI Card to get this card as it limits maximum two cards per person: one regular and one co-branded."%}

The hotel voucher benefit on reaching spending milestone is great and comprehensive insurance cover is best in class.

However absence of international airport lounge access on Club Vistara SBI Card is disappointing. Also no complimentary airport lounge access to add-on card member is a huge downer. Inclusion of add-on card members for airport lounge access should have made this card even better. Also the network of Air Vistara is not that great but it's improving day by day.

Even with these nuances, Club Vistara SBI Card is still a solid product and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is in to miles and points game. I also hope SBI Card soon launches the super premium version of this card, Club Vistara SBI Card ELITE, with benefits like complimentary business class tickets to lure the HNIs. Till then, I am keeping my fingers crossed!
