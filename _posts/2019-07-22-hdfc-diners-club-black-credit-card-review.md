HDFC Diners Club Black credit card is a super premium offering from HDFC Bank. This card provides the default reward rate of 3.3% which beats any credit card in Indian market. Also their [10X program](/hdfc-diners-club-credit-cards-10x-rewards-july-2019-update/) accelerates the reward rate to a whooping 33% on select partner merchants. I believe there is no better reward rate for credit cards in whole world than this. Apart from fantastic reward rate, this card offers all other features a super premium credit card is supposed to.

### Eligibility Criteria

This card is targeted for HNIs and hence eligibility criteria is tailored to target them.

- Age: 21 to 60 Years for salaried, 21 to 65 Years for self employed
- Salaried: Net Monthly Income > Rs. 1.75 Lakhs per month
- Self Employed: ITR > Rs. 21 Lakhs per annum

HDFC is very strict about the eligibility criteria for issuing new cards. However, the exceptions can be made based on your relationship with bank.

### Drawbacks

Though HDFC Diners Club Black credit card provides unparalleled benefits, it has some downsides also:

- Limited acceptability: Though coverage of Diners Club is expanding day by day, it's not as good as Visa/ Mastercard. You need to keep a backup card handy always.
- Lounge access limited to primary card member: Wish they should have extended it to add-on members too like many other super premium credit cards.
- No fuel surcharge waiver: Every other credit card provides this, not sure why this doesn't.

### Verdict

The 33% reward rate beats down any other super premium credit card in world. I won't be wrong if I say 10X program is best reward program on credit card in the whole world. If you're being offered this card, go for it without giving a second thought.
