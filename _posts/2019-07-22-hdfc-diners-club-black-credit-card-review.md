HDFC Diners Club Black credit card is a super premium offering from HDFC Bank. This card provides the default reward rate of 3.3% which beats any credit card in Indian market. Also their [10X program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/){:target="\_blank"} accelerates the reward rate to a whooping 33% on select partner merchants. I believe there is no better reward rate for credit cards in whole world than this. Apart from fantastic reward rate, this card offers all other features a super premium credit card is supposed to.

HDFC is very strict about the eligibility criteria for issuing new cards. However, the exceptions can be made based on your relationship with bank.

### Fees

HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card comes with following fees:

- Joining fee: Rs. 10,000 + GST
- Renewal fee: Rs. 10,000 + GST

Renewal fee is waived off if spend in previous year is more than Rs. 5 Lakhs. Also joining fee is waived off if you have a good standing relationship with HDFC Bank.

#### Other Benefits

- 15% discount at partner restaurants using Good Food Trail dining program
- 1% cashback (limited to Rs. 1,000 per month) on international transactions using [Global Value Program](/hdfc-global-value-program-everything-you-need-to-know/){:target="\_blank"} (annual fee of Rs. 199)

### Drawbacks

Though HDFC Diners Club Black credit card provides unparalleled benefits, it has some downsides also:

- Limited acceptability: Though coverage of Diners Club is expanding day by day, it's not as good as Visa/Mastercard. You need to keep a backup card handy always, especially outside India.
- No renewal benefits: There are no renewal benefits if your spend is less than Rs. 5 Lakhs. Earlier HDFC Bank used to compensate for renewal fee by providing reward points of equivalent value, which is not the case now.

### Verdict

The 33% reward rate beats down any other super premium credit card in world. I won't be wrong if I say [10X program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/){:target="\_blank"} is best reward program on credit card in the whole world. The annual memberships, golf privileges and unlimited airport lounge access for both primary and add-on card members is cherry on the top. If you're being offered this card, go for it without giving a second thought.
