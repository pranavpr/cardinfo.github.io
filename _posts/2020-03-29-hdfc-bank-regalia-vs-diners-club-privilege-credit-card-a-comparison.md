I have been asked umpteen times that between [HDFC Bank Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) and [Diners Club Privilege Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-launches-diners-club-privilege-credit-card-review/), which one is better? Given that both these credit cards target the same premium segment and offer similar reward rate and features, this confusion is quite valid. However there are some subtle differences between the two which set them apart.

In this article I am going to compare these cards in-depth and will articulate the major differences so that you can make an informed choice. So let's jump right in!

### Bottomline

It's evident from above comparison chart that [Diners Club Privilege](/hdfc-bank-launches-diners-club-privilege-credit-card-review/) had little edge over [Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) in terms of features and rewards. Extra 10X partners and monthly milestone benefit push the reward rate beyond 1.3%. Access to complimentary Golf games twice per quarter will entice the Golf lovers. The annual memberships really come in handy and can save you some extra money.

However the acceptance of Diners Club Cards is questionable, especially international. If you travel internationally a lot, you may face issues with acceptance of Diners Club cards. Also, even though both cards have forex markup of ~2%, Visa/MasterCard has superior conversion rate (~1%) in comparison to Diners Club. Hence stick with [Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) if you travel a lot and want better acceptance.
