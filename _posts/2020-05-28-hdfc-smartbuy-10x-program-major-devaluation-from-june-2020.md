### What changed?

The new SmartBuy 10X Program brings major changes to the structure of the program in comparison to [previous](/hdfc-bank-10x-rewards-program-february-2020-update/){:target="\_blank"} one. Let's analyze the impact on each credit/debit card category in detail to understand more.

#### HDFC Bank Infinia & Diners Club Black Credit Cards

Earlier HDFC Bank Infinia & Diners Club Black Credit Card holders used to enjoy 10X reward points on every category on transacting through SmartBuy Portal. However now only Flights, Hotels, Bus and Instant Vouchers will fetch 10X reward points. Reward points on Amazon & Rail have been sharply reduced to 5X which is like 50% reduction. Even worse, reward points on Flipkart and Compare & Shop have been reduced to 3X which is a steep 70% reduction.

The scope to earn more reward points on these cards has been reduced significantly due to restriction on categories. Due to COVID-19, the travel is restricted mostly and hence it's really difficult to squeeze 10X reward points now. Though 10X reward points can be earned on Instant Vouchers, HDFC Bank has limited the purchase of Amazon and Flipkart vouchers to Rs. 5,000 per calendar month diminishing the scope of 10X reward points even further.

Not only the reward rate and scope of earning has been reduced, but the maximum cap on reward points per calendar month has also been slashed. Earlier HDFC Infinia card members could earn 25,000 bonus reward points and Diners Club Black card members could earn 15,000 reward points per calendar month. Now these limits have been diminished to 15,000 for Infinia and 7,500 for Diners Club Black which is quite steep.

#### HDFC Diners Club and Regalia Credit Cards
 
Earlier HDFC Diners Club and Regalia Credit Cards used to get 10X reward points. However now these cards will not earn any reward points, but will earn cashback ranging from 1% to 5%. Earlier the reward rate, with 10X reward points on these cards, was around 13%. With this change, there is a reduction of 61%-92% in reward rate which is huge.

Also the maximum cashback one per calendar month has been restricted to Rs. 2,000 for Diners Club Privilege and Regalia Credit Cards. Other Diners Club Credit Cards like [ClubMiles](/hdfc-diners-club-clubmiles-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} / Premium / Rewardz and Regalia First will earn just Rs. 1,000 maximum cashback per month which is a steep devaluation.

#### Other HDFC Bank Credit & Debit Cards
 
For other HDFC Bank Credit and Debit Cards, there has been comparatively less impact. Only the cashback rate has been reduced to 1%-5% depending upon category as compared to to 5% on everything earlier. The maximum cap on cashback per calendar month has been retained to Rs. 1,000.

### Bottomline
 
HDFC Bank, though has retained the 33% reward rate for premium credit cards like [Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"}, the scope to earn more reward points has been reduced significantly by restricting the categories. Amazon and Flipkart, which were used most frequently for earning 10X rewards, have now been throttled to 5X and 3X respectively which is the major disappointment.
 
Diners Club and [Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} variants of credit cards have been impacted most. Earlier [Diners Club Privilege](/hdfc-bank-launches-diners-club-privilege-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and [HDFC Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} credit cards used to fetch 13% reward rate, but now they have been restricted to just 5%. The maximum cap of Rs. 2,000 on cashback per calendar month is a nail in the coffin. Also other Diners Club Cards and Regalia First Card, which used to fetch 10X reward points, will now earn cashbback limited to Rs. 1,000 per month just like other ordinary cards. Certainly these cards have lost their sheen in this wave of devaluation.
 
The devaluation of SmartBuy 10X program was imminent owing to the high cost structure associated with it. The 13%-33% reward is not sustainable for long term and given that the current economical situation is not so great either due to COVID-19, this devaluation makes sense. However note that you still have time till the end of this month to utilize the older SmartBuy 10X program to squeeze out the maximum benefits.
