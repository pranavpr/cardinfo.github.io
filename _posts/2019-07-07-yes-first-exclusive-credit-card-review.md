The reward rate for Yes First Exclusive Credit Cards, not only depends on spend category, but also on redemption category. Below table outlines the reward rate for various combinations:

<table  width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px #dee2e6; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;display: block;overflow-x: auto;">
<thead bgcolor="#03a87c" style="color: #ffffff;font-weight: bold;">

</table>
 
As evident from the table above, you get the maximum reward rate by spending and redeeming the reward points on the travel category.
 
Reward points can be redeemed on their dedicated reward portal [Yes Rewardz](https://www.yesrewardz.com/CreditCard/){:target="\_blank"}. Earlier there was an option to redeem the reward points for [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon){:target="\_blank"} vouchers, which they have disabled now. This was the best redemption option that was available in my opinion. However there are still some good options available like Central, Big Bazaar, Reliance Digital, Croma, Lifestyle, Pentaloons, [Cleartrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/cleartrip){:target="\_blank"} etc.
 
#### MasterCard World Golf Programme
 
- Waiver of 4 Green Fee at select golf courses in India every year
- One complimentary Golf Lesson every calendar month at select golf courses in India
 
#### Airport Lounge Access
 
- Unlimited Priority Pass international lounge access for primary and add-on card members
- Unlimited domestic lounge access for Primary and add-on cardmembers across 25+ Lounges in India using MasterCard Lounge Program
 
This is the best feature of this card in my opinion and if you are a frequent traveller, you can save a lot by utilizing this benefit. If you're thinking for a world tour with your family, this card has you covered for lounge access everywhere for all members of your family. Isn't it exciting?
 
#### Insurance Coverage
 
- Life Insurance Cover of Rs. 3 Crore for death due to Flight Accidents
- Medical Insurance cover of Rs 50 Lakhs for emergency hospitalization when traveling overseas
- Credit Shield cover for outstanding Credit Card dues in case of accidental death of Primary Cardmember
 
#### Dedicated Concierge Services
 
YES ASSIST, a dedicated concierge Service for following requests:
 
- Car Rental & Limousine Referral and Reservation Assistance
- Hotel/ Travel/ Special Events & Performance/ Restaurant Referral and Reservation Assistance
- Movie tickets assistance in New Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai
- Flower & Gift Delivery
- Emergency Towing and Roadside Repair Assistance
 
#### Low finance charges
 
- 1.75% of foreign currency markup charges
- 1.99% per month interest rate on Revolving Credit, Cash Advances and Overdue Amount
 
#### Other benefits
 
- 25% discount on movie tickets at [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow){:target="\_blank"}
- Fuel surcharge waiver for transaction between Rs. 400 to Rs. 5,000
 
### Drawbacks
 
Though this card comes with bunch of features, there are some drawbacks too which are outlined below:
 
- Low reward rate: Earlier this card used to have a reward rate of 2.5% on all spends, but after devaluations in [March 2019](/yes-bank-credit-cards-rewards-reduced/){:target="\_blank"} and [July 2020](/yes-bank-credit-cards-getting-devalued-starting-july-2020/){:target="\_blank"}, the reward rate has reduced significantly. It would be awesome if Yes Bank reinstates the earlier reward rate.
- Less redemption options in reward catalog: Their reward catalog is very limited with very few options to redeem from. If they can re-introduce [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon){:target="\_blank"}/ [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart){:target="\_blank"} vouchers, it would be great.
 
### Verdict
 
Unlimited international and domestic lounge access for primary and add-on card members, never expiring reward points and low foreign currency markup of 1.75% are some of the notable features of this card which keeps it relevant in the current scenario. However the continuous [devaluations](/yes-bank-credit-cards-getting-devalued-starting-july-2020/){:target="\_blank"} have rendered Yes First Exclusive Credit Card not as attractive as before. I would suggest to go for this card only if it's offered for life time free. It doesn't make any sense to pay such a high annual fee for so little reward rate.

If you're looking for a super premium credit card, I would suggest to explore [HDFC Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} or [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"}.
