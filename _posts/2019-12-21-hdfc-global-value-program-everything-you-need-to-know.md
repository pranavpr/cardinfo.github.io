### Personal Experience

I enrolled for Global Value Program on my [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/) by calling the dedicated support line. The agent explained me the benefits of the card and placed a request for enrollment on my card after getting a confirmation. My card was charged same day and I received an SMS on my mobile, exactly 3 days after, confirming the activation of program on my card.

Next day I swiped my card on international POS machine to make a payment. To my surprise, the welcome reward points were credited to my card just after the generation of the monthly statement. The cashback amount too was posted to my card 2 days after the generation of monthly statement. I also received an SMS confirming the credit of cashback amount to my card.

### Bottomline

This is a fantastic offering from HDFC Bank which helps you compensate for forex currency markup fees. The welcome/renewal benefits itself cover the cost of this program. I would highly recommend you to enroll for this program even if you do just one international transaction in a year.
