Yes Bank, this month again, sent a spend based targeted offer wherein you'll get [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) vouchers on meeting the target. The target is lower than [previous month](/yes-bank-credit-card-spend-based-offers-may-2019/) and so is reward rate. It seems, many people stopped using Yes Bank credit cards after [Yes Bank devalued their cards](/yes-bank-credit-cards-rewards-reduced/). Hence Yes Bank is desperately trying to retain the customer base using spend based offers and [accelerated rewards](/yes-bank-launches-yes-cart-a-compare-and-buy-portal-for-yes-bank-cards/).

### Offer Details

- **Offer:** Get [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) e-Voucher on reaching spend target
- **Period:** 19th June 2019 to 29th June 2019 (inclusive of both days)
- **Excluded Transactions:** Cash withdrawals done on Yes Bank Credit Card
- **Type:** Targeted, not valid if communication is not received from Yes Bank
- **Fulfillment:** [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) e-Voucher will be communicated to the eligible card members by 31st July 2019
- **Source:** SMS & Email
- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.yesbank.in/pdf/month_end_spends_terms_and_conditions_pdf)

This month I received following target over e-mail followed by a SMS:

<table class="table" style="display: block;overflow-x: auto;">
<thead class="thead-dark">
<tr>
	<th scope="col"> Net Spends Target</th>
	<th scope="col"> Amazon e-Voucher</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td> Rs. 20,000 </td>
	<td> Rs. 500 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I suspect the low target is due to fact that I have almost stopped using my Yes First Exclusive card after the [devaluation](/yes-bank-credit-cards-rewards-reduced/) and transferred all my spends to [HDFC Diners Club Black](/best-credit-cards-of-2019-in-india/#2-hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card). Anyways, this offer translates to a reward rate of 2.5% over and above existing rewards which is quite low when compared with [previous month spend based offer](/yes-bank-credit-card-spend-based-offers-may-2019/).

_Did you receive any spend based offer from Yes Bank this month too? What is your spend target? Let me know in comments below._
