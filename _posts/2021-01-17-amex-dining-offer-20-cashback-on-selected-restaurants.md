The offer is applicable on some of the famous dining restaurant chains in India, e.g., AB's, Barbecue Nation, Beer Cafe, Hard Rock Cafe, Mainland China, Pizza Express, Punjab Grill, Sigree Global Grill etc. Let's dive into offer details to know more.

### Bottomline

Though this offer from Amex is not as exciting as their [Shop Small offer](/amex-shop-small-offer-50-cashback-on-small-business-spends/){:target="\_blank"} last month wherein they not only offered 50% cashback, but also offered Rs. 1,500 as maximum cashback. However 20% cashback up to Rs. 750 is also a great offer. I wish Amex could have included online delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy too to reach and benefit more cardmembers.
