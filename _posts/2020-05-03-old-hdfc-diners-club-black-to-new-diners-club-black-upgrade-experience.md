HDFC Bank [announced](/hdfc-bank-introduces-new-benefits-on-diners-club-black-credit-card/){:target="\_blank"} a new version of Diners Club Black credit card in November last year. Apart from refreshing the design, HDFC also announced annual membership benefits on new variant of the card. These annual benefits were not rolled out to existing Diners Club Members and one could only avail after meeting the upgrade criteria.

Recently, I got upgraded from old Diners Club Black to new Diners Club Black. Hence in this article, I am articulating my upgrade experience and answers to some of the frequently asked questions. So without further ado, let's get started.

### Background

I hold a lifetime free (LTF) [Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} which I got based on my long banking relationship (10+ Years) with HDFC Bank. When HDFC Bank announced the new version of Diners Club Black credit card, I was little disappointed as annual membership benefits were not extended to existing card holders. However HDFC Bank gave following three options to upgrade to new version of the card:

1. Upgrade to a new HDFC Bank Diners Club Black Credit Card with joining/renewal fees of Rs. 10,000/-. The upgrade can be done via NetBanking or PhoneBanking.
2. Spend Rs. 2.50 Lakhs in the period Aug 2019 to Oct 2019 or Nov 2019 to Jan 2020 to upgrade to new Diners Club Black after 1st December 2019 under current pricing of existing card.
3. Spend Rs. 8 Lakhs in a year and get an upgrade to new Diners Club Black at the time of Card Anniversary under current pricing of existing card.

I didn't want to convert my lifetime free card to paid one and hence I ruled out the first option. I missed the option two by very less margin and hence I couldn't avail that too.

However when I called HDFC Premium Card Services number, the representative told me that I can still upgrade to the new card using the third option. She also told me that I'm shy of a few thousands for achieving the target and advised me to go for it. Obviously this was a no brainer for me and I pursued this route to get the upgrade.

### Experience

I continued spending on my Diners Club Black to achieve the spending target of Rs. 8 Lakhs. To my surprise, I observed that HDFC Bank has made the progress, towards achieving the spends milestone, available in reward portal as shown below:

This helped in keeping track of my spending towards achieving the annual milestone benefits.

When I reached the anniversary month, I waited for a couple of weeks for receiving communication from HDFC Bank regarding the upgrade. Since I didn't get any communication, I again rang up the HDFC Premium Card Services number. The representative confirmed that indeed I have qualified for the annual membership benefits. He told me that I will get the mail about the same within 30 days of my card anniversary date and my anniversary date has not reached yet. He asked me to wait for some time and asked me to call back if I don't receive the communication within this timeline.

I started waiting for the same and then COVID-19 lockdown happened. I was not hopeful of getting anything in this period and hence I didn't pay much heed to it. However to my surprise, HDFC Bank sent the annual benefits emailer exactly on 30th day from my anniversary date.

I clicked the "Redeem Now" button in excitement to avail the benefits. It landed me on to the [rewards portal](https://hdfcbankdinersclub.poshvine.com/){:target="\_blank"} where I needed to sign in using my mobile number and first and last four digits of my card. After signing in, I was presented with all annual benefits available on my Diners Club Black card as shown below:

{% include image.html image="hdfc-diners-club-black-annual-milestone-benefits-redemption-portal.jpg" alt="HDFC Diners Club Black Annual Milestone Benefits Redemption Portal" class="img-center mb-3" %}

I immediately claimed the Amazon Prime Membership offer thinking it would be an Amazon Voucher of Rs. 999 which can be added to Amazon Pay wallet. I received the Amazon Prime voucher code in another emailer. However when I tried to add this voucher code to Amazon Pay wallet, it errored out, meaning it couldn't be added to Amazon Pay wallet.

I already had an active annual Amazon Prime membership which I cancelled to avail this benefit. Amazon refunded the amount to my card on a pro-rated basis which was a really good gesture. Post that I went to [this](https://www.amazon.in/prime/promo/landing?promoID=AMIOJGQUEMR4F){:target="\_blank"} page which has been especially created to redeem Amazon Prime voucher for HDFC Bank customers.

{% include image.html image="hdfc-diners-club-black-amazon-prime-redemption-page.jpg" alt="HDFC Diners Club Black Amazon Prime Redemption Page" class="img-center mb-3" %}

I entered the voucher code on this page and was able to avail the benefit. Overall it was a really pleasant and hassle free experience. I haven't availed the other benefits yet as I won't be able to leverage those in the current situation due to lockdown. I'll avail them once the lockdown is lifted and the situation normalizes.
