It comes to me as a surprise that their super premium card, Amex Platinum Card, is excluded from this offer. Not sure what's the strategy of Amex here.

**PS:** If you don't have Amex, you can apply via my referral link below. Signing up using this link will give you card **free** for first year and **2000** extra referral bonus reward points in addition to **2000** bonus reward points which is not available otherwise.
