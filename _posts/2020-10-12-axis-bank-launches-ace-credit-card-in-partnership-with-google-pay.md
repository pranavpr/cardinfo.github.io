### Fees

Axis Bank ACE Credit Card comes with following fees:

- Joining fee: Rs. 499 + GST
- Renewal fee: Rs. 499 + GST

Joining fee is reversed upon spending Rs. 10,000 within 45 days of card setup which seems quite reasonable. Renewal fee is also waived off on achieving an annual spend of Rs. 2 Lakhs.

### Features

{% include tip.html tip="Under a limited period offer Axis Bank is waiving off joining fees for applications received till 31 December 2020." %}

#### Launch Offer

Under a limited time launch offer, Axis Bank ACE Credit Card holders can enjoy a 5% cashback on Big Basket and Grofers. This offer is valid till 31st December 2020. There is no mention of minimum order amount and maximum cashback and hence it seems there are no such limits, which is great.

#### Rewards

- 5% cashback on bill payments via Google Pay. Following categories are covered:
  - Electricity
  - Internet
  - Gas
  - DTH
  - Mobile Recharge
- 4% cashback on Swiggy, Zomato and Ola
- 2% cashback on all other spends except following:
  - Fuel
  - Wallet Load
  - EMI

Cashback earned for the purchases during a billing cycle will be credited in the next billing cycle 3 days prior to the statement generation date. 5% unlimited cashback on bill payments is really great and there aren't any cards in the market which provide the same without any cap. The default 2% cashback on other spends is simply amazing and it's highest among entry level credit cards released so far.

#### Airport Lounge Access

Axis Bank ACE Credit Card provides 4 complimentary access to domestic lounges per year. Below airport lounges are covered via this card:

The list seems decent and most metros are covered.
 
#### Other Benefits
 
- 1% fuel surcharge waiver all transactions between Rs. 400 to Rs. 4,000, maximum up to Rs. 500 per month
- 20% off on partner restaurants participating in [Dining Delights Program](https://diningdelights.axisbank.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
- Convert purchases over Rs. 2,000 to EMI
 
### Drawbacks
 
Though Axis Bank ACE Credit Card is a fantastic entry level lifestyle credit card, there are some downsides too.
 
- The spend criteria for waiver of renewal fee is Rs. 2 Lakhs which is on a higher side I believe. I wish Axis Bank should have kept this limit lower.
- There are no joining and renewal benefits in lieu of fees paid, which is a little disappointing.
 
### Verdict
 
The 5% unlimited cashback on bill payments makes Axis Bank ACE Credit Card really attractive. None of the cards in the market currently provide unlimited cashback on bill payments. This makes this card stand out from the masses.
 
Also the 2% default reward rate is simply amazing and beats every other entry level credit card in the market right now. If you're looking for a simple cashback credit card, look no further and go for this card blindly.
