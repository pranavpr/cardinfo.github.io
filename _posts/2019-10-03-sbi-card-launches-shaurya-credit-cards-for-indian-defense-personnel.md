### Bottomline

Shaurya SBI Cards are entry level lifestyle credit cards suitable for low spenders. I don't see any striking difference between this and other credit card already in market. In fact, Shaurya Select SBI Card provides rewards similar to [SBI SimplySave Credit Card](/sbi-simplysave-credit-card-review/). I wish SBI Card should have given something extra from their normal credit cards as these are meant for defense personnel who save our nation from external threats. I am utterly disappointed with these cards and I see no value in them.
