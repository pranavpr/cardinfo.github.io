Though the reward rate looks paltry on [American Express Membership Rewards Credit Card](/american-express-membership-rewards-credit-card-mrcc-review/), this card shines when you redeem the Membership Rewards Points from 18 Karat or 24 Karat Gold collection. Let's do a sample math to calculate the reward rate when you just do 4 transactions of Rs. 1,000 every month and redeem from 18 Karat Gold Collection.

<div class="border p-4 mb-4 bg-lightblue article-info">
   Regular Membership Rewards Points earned on spending Rs. 4,000 = 80 <br/>
   Bonus Membership Rewards Points earned on spending Rs. 4,000 = 1,000<br/>
   Total Membership Rewards Points earned on spending Rs. 4,000 = 1,080<br/>
   Now, 18,000 Membership Rewards Points = Rs. 6,000<br/>
   Hence, value of 1,080 Membership Rewards Points = Rs. 360<br/>
   Therefore, Reward Rate = <strong>9%</strong>
</div>
 
Only catch with this card is to get the maximum cashback rate, you need to limit your spends to 4 transactions of Rs. 1,000 (total Rs. 4,000) per month.
