HDFC Bank Regalia Credit Card has been most popular and successful product from HDFC Bank. [Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) was one of the first premium credit card offerings in Indian market and hence was most sought after at one time. However, owing to premium features and high eligibility criteria, it was not in reach of everyone. Hence, to en-cash the popularity of Regalia, HDFC Bank launched Regalia First Credit Card as an entry level card to reach out the masses. However, there are some subtle differences between the two which I am outlining in this article.

### Bottomline

From above comparison chart, it's quite evident that though Regalia and Regalia share the similar features, the benefits in Regalia First are lower than Regalia. This is quite expected as Regalia has higher income eligibility criteria and annual fees than Regalia First.
