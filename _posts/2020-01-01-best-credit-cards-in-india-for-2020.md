### Bottomline

The credit card market in India has changed a lot in last year due to the launch of multiple co-branded credit cards. These credit cards have not only presented multiple options to end users, but have also pushed the benefits to a whole new level. I personally feel that the credit card market will keep on evolving this year too.

To reap maximum benefits, you may get multiple credit cards. However make sure you have a strategy in place to reap the maximum benefits out of them.
Also don't apply for multiple credit cards in short span of time, it may hamper your credit (CIBIL) score as lenders will see you credit hungry. Spread out the applications over a period of time to lower the impact and one application per 6 months is a good place to start.
