HDFC Infinia or Diners Club Black: which one is better? I have been asked this question multiple times and hence I decided to write an in-depth comparison between the two.

Those who are not aware, HDFC Infinia and Diners Club Black, both are super premium credit cards from HDFC Bank. Both these cards feature great reward rate, unlimited airport lounge access, golf privileges, 24x7 concierge, insurance cover and dedicated support line. However there are some subtle differences between the two which I am going to show you in a while. Let's get started!

### Bottomline

It's evident from above comparison chart that both cards are neck-to-neck in features and rewards. Both card offer great default reward rate and equivalent features. You can never go wrong in getting either of the two.

However if you see your self traveling internationally a lot, consider going for [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/) due to better acceptance. And if your primary concern is reward rate, go for [HDFC Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) as monthly milestone benefits push the reward rate further by 1.25%, making it overall 4.55%.
