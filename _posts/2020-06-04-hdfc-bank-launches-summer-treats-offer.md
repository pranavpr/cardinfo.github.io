HDFC Bank launched the Summer Treats Offer today wherein they are providing a wide range of offers across Credit Cards, Debit Cards, EMIs, Loans and Payzapp wallet. This offer is very similar to [Festive Treats Offer](/hdfc-bank-festive-treats-partner-merchant-offers/){:target="\_blank"} which they ran last year. There are numerous offers available across multiple merchants, both online and offline, to attract the customers as lock down is easing out. Let's look into some of the prominent offers in detail.

On the other hand HDFC Credit Card holders can enjoy 50% bonus reward points on online spends. Finally Payzapp users can enjoy 5% cashback upto Rs. 200 per month for bill payment.

Though the offer is decent, the low limit on bonus reward points and cashback kills the joy.

- **Period:** 15 May 2020 to 30 September 2020

Though the offer seems decent, the only worrying bit is that it's a contest and only few winners selected by HDFC Bank will get the vouchers. This kills the joy for most as you never if you are getting selected or not.
 
### Mobiles
 
HDFC Bank is providing instant discount for online offers and cashback for offline purchases of mobile phones. Below table summarizes the offer on various mobile phones:
 
<table  width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px #dee2e6; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;display: block;overflow-x: auto;">

   <td><ul><li>Rs. 1,000 instant discount on Credit Card and Debit Card EMI transactions</li><li>Rs. 500 instant discount on on Debit Cards</li></ul></td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 
Seems to be a decent offer and deal can be further sweetened using [SmartBuy 10X program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/).
 
### Laptop & Tablets
 
HDFC Bank is providing an attractive discount on Macbooks and iPads. Refer table below for details:
 
<table  width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px #dee2e6; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;display: block;overflow-x: auto;">
<thead bgcolor="#03a87c" style="color: #ffffff;font-weight: bold;">

</tbody>
</table>
 
- **Valid Till:** 30 June 2020

This is a nice offer on Apple devices and apart from discount, you can also get accelerated reward points using [SmartBuy 10X program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/) on Amazon / Flipkart.
 
### Household Durables
 
HDFC Bank is also providing attractive discounts on household durables as tabulated below:
 
<table  width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px #dee2e6; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;display: block;overflow-x: auto;">
<thead bgcolor="#03a87c" style="color: #ffffff;font-weight: bold;">
 <tr>
   <th>Product</th>
   <th>Brand</th>
   <th>Offer</th>
 </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
 <tr>
   <td>Refrigerator</td>
   <td>LG, Samsung, Voltas</td>
   <td>17.5% cashback</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Washing Machine</td>
   <td>LG, Samsung, Voltas</td>
   <td>17.5% cashback</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Dishwasher</td>
   <td>LG, Voltas</td>
   <td>12.5% cashback</td>
 </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 
This seems to be a lucrative offer, however note that this discount is generally applicable on MRP and you may get a better deal by haggling with the shopkeeper. You may also get a better deal online on Amazon / Flipkart during special sale days. So compare all options before taking the plunge.
 
### Payzapp
 
HDFC Bank is also providing some exclusive offers on Payzapp wallet. Some of them are mentioned below:
 
- 3X reward points on Flipkart on using HDFC Credit Card via Payzapp, 1% cashback on paying via Payzapp card
- Cashback on food delivery merchants
  - Dominos Pizza: 15%
  - Freshmenu: 15%
  - Zomato: 10% on groceries
  - Swiggy: 15%
 
The Flipkart offer looks interesting, however I couldn't find the exact terms and conditions to know the maximum cap on bonus reward points.
 
### Other Deals
 
Apart from above offers, HDFC Bank has also announced many other deals in different categories of merchants like Health & Wellness, Online Education, Online streaming, Jewelry & Apparels etc. Some of the prominent offers are listed below:
 
- Croma: Rs. 2,000 cashback
- TataCLIQ: Rs. 2000 discount of on purchases of Rs. 25,x000 on HDFC Bank Credit Cards
- Spar: 7% cashback up to Rs. 350
- Grofers: 5% instant discount up to Rs. 250
- Zee5: 20% discount on Zee5 premium subscription
- Bluestone: 5% discount on Diamond jewelry purchase of Rs. 20,000 and above. Max. discount of Rs 2,000
 
### Bottomline
 
The volume of transactions is increasing steadily as lock down is easing out gradually. HDFC Bank wants to encash this opportunity by rolling out offers on almost all segments to attract customers. This seems to be a good strategy to capture the major chunk of overall spends. However, to be frank, none of the offers impressed me and I found them just okayish. I hope HDFC will roll some better offers as part of the Summer Treats Offer in the coming days.
