### How to apply?

One can apply for Standard Chartered DigiSmart credit card online by filling below form on Standard Chartered website:

<a href="https://apply.standardchartered.co.in/credit-card?selectedCardId=14" target="_blank" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger btn-block post-element mt-2" rel="noopener"><i class="ci-pen"></i> Apply Now</a>

Note that existing Standard Chartered credit card holders can't apply for this card online using above form and they should contact back directly over phone banking for the same.

### Bottomline

Standard Chartered, [just like HDFC](/hdfc-bank-millennia-cards-launched/), is trying to tap the millennial segment which constitute 34% of India's population. The reward rate across the selected merchants is fabulous and low monthly fee and threshold for monthly fee waiver is indeed exciting. Inclusion of [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) or [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) to this list would have made this card even better.

However absence of reward points on spends made using this card is a big bummer. It simply means absolutely no benefit on using this card on merchants apart from their partners. Also no domestic airport lounge access, which is provided by some cards in this segment, is again disappointing.

One should go for this card only if their major spend is spread across the partnered merchants. Personally I would give this card a pass and would rather recommend [Amazon Pay ICICI](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/), [Flipkart Axis](/flipkart-axis-bank-credit-card-review-and-hands-on-experience/) or [HDFC Millennia](/hdfc-bank-millennia-cards-launched/) credit card to beginners.
