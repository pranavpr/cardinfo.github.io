          You can do couple of things:
          <ul><li>Make sure your email address is listed in their marketing list. Call customer care and get yourself added if you never receive any email from informations@hdfcbank.net.</li><li>HDFC Bank sends these targeted offers to those customers whose spend is on the lesser side on HDFC credit card. Try to shift your spends to some other credit card for a few months and see if that kicks in the offer emailers.</li></ul>

### Bottomline

I received this offer on my [HDFC Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-upgrade-experience/){:target="\_blank"} where my spending has reduced significantly. I received a spend target of Rs. 1,50,000 for a voucher of Rs. 3,000.

Overall it's a nice offer and, in my case, it translates to an incremental reward rate of 2% making the overall reward rate around 5.3% which is amazing. However I don't think I would be able to utilize this offer as the spend target is quite high.

_Did you receive this offer on your HDFC Bank Credit Card? What's your spend target and how much voucher amount would you be getting on meeting this target? Let me know by leaving a quick comment below._
