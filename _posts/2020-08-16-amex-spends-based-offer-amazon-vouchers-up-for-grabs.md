### Bottomline

This is a decent offer from Amex and the reward rate varies between 5% to 8.33% depending on your segment. Any retail transaction on your Amex card would be considered for this offer, even wallet reloads which is quite nice.

I received this offer on my American Express Gold card wherein I have to spend Rs. 25,000 for an Amazon voucher worth Rs. 1,500. I am planning to shift purchases to my American Express Gold card from [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} for next 30 days to utilize this offer.
