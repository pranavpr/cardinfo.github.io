American Express (Amex) has partnered with Hype to provide luxury car experience to Centurion and Platinum Charge cardmembers. Hype is a luxury car rental company which provides self-driving cars from Toyota Land Cruiser to a Maserati Ghibli, or a chauffeur-driven Ferrari 458 to Rolls Royce Ghost. They are also working on bringing Yachts and Private Jets on their platform.

Let's look into the details to see what Amex has to offer.

### Offer Details

Under the new offer rolled out by Amex, it will provide monthly free credits to Centurion and Platinum Charge cardmembers to offset the booking charges at Hype. Below are the monthly free credits for each card:

   <td> American Express Platinum Card </td>
   <td> Rs. 7,500 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>

Apart from free monthly credits, Centurion and Platinum Charge cardmembers can also avail the complimentary Platinum Tier membership of Hype for one year. The Platinum Tier membership of Hype comes with following benefits:
 
- 25% discount on all car rentals
- Free pickup & transfer for all self-drives (25 Km radius from the garage, within city limits)
- Zero cancellation and rescheduling charges
 
Note that you can't combine the monthly credits with a 25% discount and you have to choose one between the two.
 
To avail this offer, you need to sign up with Hype using the link provided in the offers section in the benefits dashboard of your card. Post sign-up, the monthly credits would be available in your Hype account and you should be able to use them right away.
 
### Bottomline
 
It's certainly a unique proposition from American Express and will certainly entice those who are into luxury cars. However I believe, Centurion card holders would already own one of the luxury cars and they won't perceive it as a huge benefit. However the choice of multiple luxury cars at a disposal is not a bad idea either.
