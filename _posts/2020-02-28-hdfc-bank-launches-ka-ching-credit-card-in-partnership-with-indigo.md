{% include image.html image="6e-rewards.jpg" alt="6E Rewards" class="img-center mb-3" %}

6E Rewards Program is not a frequent flier program, but is a rewards program connected to Ka-Ching Credit Cards. Members can redeem the 6E Rewards for 6E Rewards’ Benefits which include IndiGo flights. 6E Rewards can be redeemed by members online, by logging into their Membership Account. 6E Rewards will be accrued for a minimum transaction of Rs. 100. The rewards are valid for 24 months from the date of accrual on a 'first in first out basis'. For flight booking, there is a reward redemption fee of Rs. 100 + GST per pax.

### Bottomline

Ka-Ching Credit Card series from HDFC Bank are decent credit cards. Given that IndiGo has the best domestic connectivity in India, possessing a co-branded credit card from them makes sense for most of us. However this credit card is invite only as of now and IndiGo will be inviting their customers for the same. I anticipate a gradual rollout to everyone by the end of next quarter.

IndiGo could have done better by rolling out a full fledged frequent flyer program instead of a reward program. With the recent sunset of Jet Airways, IndiGo has a huge opportunity to capture the market. They should act sooner as Vistara is slowly and steadily catching up and their fantastic Club Vistara frequent flyer program has become favorite of many frequent travelers.
