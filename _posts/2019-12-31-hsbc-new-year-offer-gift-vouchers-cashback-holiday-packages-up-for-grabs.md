### Bottomline

HSBC has become really aggressive recently and has been pushing out many offers for their card members. Talking about this offer, HSBC Bank has clubbed three offers together in this "New Year Offer". Though the first monthly offer is applicable for only those who received the communication, remaining two are available to all card members.

One thing to note here is that eligibility of cardmembers' to first two offers is considered only from the month onwards in which he/she registers. However a cardholder registering for any of the months (i.e. anytime between Offer Period), would be eligible for the bumper prize and spend across all three months would be considered. Below table summarizes the same:

I didn't receive Offer 1 on my HSBC Platinum Visa Credit Card. However I registered for Offer 2 and Bumper Prize by sending SMS and I got following message as acknowledgement:

> HSBC: Congratulations on a successful registration! You are now on your way to attractive cashback benefits, gift vouchers of your choice and a chance to win an international holiday package. Shopping, dining and traveling in 2020 become even more grand with your HSBC Credit Card. Click https://hsbc.co.in/offers to know about other exciting offers that will add to your celebrations!

Though this offer is decent, I would be giving it a pass as I didn't receive the targeted offer. Without targeted offer, the reward rate is just 2.5% (2% cashback + 0.5% [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow) voucher), that too on a minimum spending of Rs. 1 Lakh. I would continue to use my [HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) which gives me not only 3.3% default reward rate, but also monthly milestone benefits, pushing overall reward rate to 4.55%.

With targeted offer the overall reward rates pushes to 3.5% (considering Rs. 1,000 gift voucher + 2% cashback + 0.5% BookMyShow voucher) on spends of Rs. 1 Lakh which is quite great. If you received the targeted offer and would be able to spend at-least Rs. 1 Lakh in a month, go for it blindly.
