Kotak Mahindra Bank has just rolled out an offer on their credit cards for international spends. Under this offer, they are providing 5% cashback on all international transactions.

### Bottomline

I received this offer on my Kotak Royale Credit Card which I don't use frequently. I registered for this offer by sending SMS and got below confirmation message in reply:

> Thank you for registration. Cashback/Reward pts. will be credited to your account within 60 days post campaign end date.

Though the T&C on website & email says that the cashback would be credited before 90 days, the confirmation SMS says 60 days. I guess Kotak needs to work on this aspect so that information provided across channels is consistent.

Note that for international transactions, a forex markup fee of 3.5% + GST (4.13%) is charged. Hence, after deducting the forex markup, the net reward rate turns out to be 0.87% which is decent. I would recommend to use this offer for international spends unless you have [other better cards with low forex markup](/best-credit-cards-in-india-with-low-forex-currency-markup-for-international-travel-spends/).
