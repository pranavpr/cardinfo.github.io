Visa, in order to push for contact less payments, has partnered up with SBI to provide 10% cashback on all contact less transactions done on POS machines.

## Offer Details

- **Offer**: 10% cashback on contact less transactions with Visa SBI Credit Cards

Though it's a nice offer with return rate of 10%, the maximum cashback of Rs. 200 is little disappointing.
