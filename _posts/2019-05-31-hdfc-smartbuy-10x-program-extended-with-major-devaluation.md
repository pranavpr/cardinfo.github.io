HDFC 10X Reward Points program on [Smartbuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com) portal has been further extended till 30 June 2019. However this extension comes with a major devaluation. The maximum reward points that can be earned per month now is capped to 5,000 which is one-fifth of previous promotions.

Note that the terms and conditions are not yet updated on [Smartbuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com) portal, however they are updated on dedicated [Diners Club](https://www.hdfcbankdinersclub.com/privilege) website.

### Offer Details

- 10X Reward Points on HDFC Bank Credit Cards
- This covers Flights, Hotels, Flipkart/Amazon and Compare & Shop on [Smartbuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com)
- Offer Validity: 1 June 2019 â€“ 30 June 2019
- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.hdfcbankdinersclub.com/privilege)

### Maximum Cap

- 5,000 Reward Points on Credit Cards

### Fulfillment

- Reward Points will be posted within 90 working days from the last date of transaction month.

### Bottomline

This devaluation was bound to happen as the program was too good to be true. With new cap in place, HDFC Infinia and Diners Club Black card holders can get maximum value till they spend Rs. 15,000 using [Smartbuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com) which is quite low for these super premium cards.
