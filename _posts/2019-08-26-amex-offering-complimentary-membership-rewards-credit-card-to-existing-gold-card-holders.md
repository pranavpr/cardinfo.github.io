This is a fantastic offer from Amex as it enables card members to accumulate bonus reward points at double rate. I received this offer on my Gold Charge card which I am using just 6 times in a month to get 1,000 bonus reward points as my primary driver is [HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/). I signed up for the new card as soon as I received this offer in my mailbox.
