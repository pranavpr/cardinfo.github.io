### Bottomline

As you can see the default reward rate and benefits on debit cards is lower than credit cards. Hence it's wise to use a credit card rather than a debit card. However if you don't want to use a credit card for some reason, you can always choose a debit card from the above list based on your convenience.

However while choosing a debit card, don't just blindly look at the reward rate. You should look at the presence of the bank's branch near your place, robust online banking facilities and customer service. Select one where you can find a balance among these.
