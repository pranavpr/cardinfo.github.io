HDFC is showering offers this quarter and they are offering 5% cashback on online spends with their debit cards. This offer would be helpful to earn cashback on merchants which are not covered under [5% cashback program for debit cards on Smartbuy](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-july-2019-update/).

HDFC is trying hard to push the online usage of their debit cards and this offer may help them in this regard. However I feel the maximum capping of Rs. 500 is pretty low and HDFC should have increased the limit considering the offer is running for 3 months. Also cashback redemption process is not straight forward and I wish HDFC would have just credited the cashback directly to the bank account without the need of redeeming it manually via net banking or phone banking.
