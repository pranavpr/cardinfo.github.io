As a launch campaign, both the entities will run a special cashback program where card members can receive a cashback of 15% for POS transactions outside India. Additionally, card members will receive a further 15% (total 30%) in select popular destinations including Thailand, Singapore and UAE. More details on this offer are awaited.

The in-city lounges are unique offering from JCB and allow card members a convenient place to rest, leave baggage, local assistance with bookings, use WiFi and enjoy refreshments in prominent areas of the city. These lounges are located in key cities across the globe like Paris, Los Angeles, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok amongst others.

### Bottomline

This year, so far, has been very good for Indian card industry. We have seen the launch of may co-branded credit cards with fabulous offers. Launch of a new card network takes the games to a whole new level. I am really excited with the launch of JCB in India and expect more and more offers on it's cards to attract people.
