### Bottomline

This is a similar [offer](https://cardinfo.in/amex-spends-based-offer-amazon-vouchers-up-for-grabs/){:target="\_blank"} which Amex launched in August 2020. Only difference being the reward rate is slightly lower for certain spend targets.

I received this offer on my American Express Gold card wherein I have to spend Rs. 15,000 for an Amazon voucher worth Rs. 750. I believe I received a lower target as I don't use this card frequently.

It's nice to see that card issuers are rolling out festive offers to their card members. Let's hope that more and more offers make our way to make the festive season rewarding.
