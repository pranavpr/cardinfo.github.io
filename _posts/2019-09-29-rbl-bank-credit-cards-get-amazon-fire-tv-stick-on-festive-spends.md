RBL Bank has revealed the **#KaroDilSeCelebrate** festive offer on their credit cards wherein they are providing assured [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) Fire TV Stick on meeting the spends criteria. This offer is somewhat similar to least year's festive offer wherein they provided [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) Echo Dot (3rd Generation) on meeting the spends criteria. The spends criteria is based on usage pattern of the card and more you use the card, higher the spends target.

### Offer Details

- **Offer**: Get an assured [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) Fire TV Stick on meeting the spends target
- **Period**: 29th September 2019 to 31st October 2019
- **Minimum Spend**: As communicated by RBL Bank in email
- **Type**: Open for all RBL Bank Credit Card members
- **Fulfillment**: [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) Fire TV Stick e-vouchers will be sent on or before 30th November 30 2019, which can be redeemed on [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) website or mobile app
- **Exclusions**:
  - Not available for Corporate Cardmembers
  - Not valid on cash withdrawals, balance transfer or dial for cash.
- **Source**: Email, [Website](https://www.rblbank.com/offers-and-deals/karo-dil-se-celebrate)

### Bottomline

I like this offer for it's simplicity: no exclusions on merchant type, no hassle of explicitly registering for offer etc. The reward rate of this offer will depend on spends target received. I received a spends target of Rs. 2 Lakhs on my RBL Bank Fun+ Credit Card which translates to a reward rate of 2% (considering the MRP of [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) Fire Stick as Rs. 3,999). If you received a lower target, the reward rate would increase even further.

I would be giving this offer a pass as spends target is quite high for me. I wish RBL Bank should have given multiple spends targets and rewards in accordance with them. However, if you are holding a RBL Bank Credit Card and actively using it, this would a great time to extract more benefit out of that.

_What spends target you received on your RBL Bank Credit Card? Let me know in comments below._
