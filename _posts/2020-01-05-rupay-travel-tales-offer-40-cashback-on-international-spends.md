### Bottomline

NPCI has been pushing hard for adoption and acceptance of RuPay cards in India and abroad. They already have partnership with Discover Financial Services (DFS) for acceptance of RuPay cards accepting DinersClub/Discover cards. Recently NPCI has [partnered with JCB](/jcb-cards-launched-in-india/) to further increase the international acceptance of RuPay cards. With that, now RuPay cards can be swiped on POS machines accepting JCB or Discover cards. They have also [launched multiple credit and debit cards](/rupay-select-credit-debit-cards-launched/) in partnership with all major banks recently to increase the availability of RuPay Cards.

Now almost all major banks in India issue international debit and credit cards on RuPay platform. Recently ICICI has even launched their famous gemstone collection, <em>viz.</em> Coral, Rubyx and Sapphiro, in RuPay flavor.

Coming to this offer, 40% cashback is like a dream come true and, without a doubt, the best offer for international spends right now. To gain maximum out of this offer, do transactions between Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 10,000. If you need to do transactions more than Rs. 10,000 consider splitting the transaction across multiple RuPay cards. Also RuPay-Discover cards have better coverage than RuPay-JCB and hence if you are going for a new card/upgrading your existing Visa/MasterCard, consider opting for the former.
