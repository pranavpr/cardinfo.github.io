### Bottomline

This offer translates to a reward rate of **5.87%** after deducting the foreign currency markup fee of 3.5% + GST. This is a really good offer and can help you save some bucks on your international vacation. I wish ICICI Bank should have kept a higher cap for maximum cashback and should have made the offer available on their credit cards too.
