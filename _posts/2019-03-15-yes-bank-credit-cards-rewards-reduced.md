It came to me as a shocker that reward rate on all Yes Bank credit cards except Yes Private has been reduced. I am summarizing the changes for Yes First variants below:

### Yes First Exclusive

- **Current:** **2.5%** on all retail spends
- **Revised:** **3%** on Travel Agencies & Tour Operators, Domestic Airlines and Dining, **1.5%** on all other categories

### Yes First Preferred

- **Current:** **2%** on all retail spends
- **Revised:** **2%** on Travel Agencies & Tour Operators, Domestic Airlines and Dining, **1%** on all other categories

For other variants, you can see the update on [Yes Bank](https://www.yesbank.in/ccproductupdate) website. These changes will be effective from **15 April 2019**.

It's worth noticing that other benefits like unlimited lounge access and low foreign currency markup fee of 1.75% have been retained. However I am quite skeptical that these benefits will continue for long. Also, though these cards have low foreign markup fee, the reduced reward rate can't cover them now.

_With these changes, Yes First Exclusive is no more my primary card. I would be shifting all my spends to HDFC Diners Club Black which I acquired recently and has reward rate of 3.3%. What about you? Let me know in comments._
