While fuel prices are sky rocketing these days, selecting a credit card carefully can give you some relief by providing extra rewards and benefits. However one should use the credit cards listed above mainly for fuel spends as that's where they provide the best reward rate. For other spends, I would advise to select one credit card from the list of [best credit cards in India](/best-credit-cards-of-2019-in-india/).
