[Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) in collaboration with Citi Bank launched [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) First Credit Card in India today. It is a co-branded card issued on Visa network. This is a entry level lifestyle card with low joining fee and simplified reward rate.

#### Eligibility Criteria

Citi and [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) have jointly developed a selection tool which will identify the potential user base for [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) First credit card. This will help those users immensely who don't have a credit history as [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) First card will be offered based on an individual's digital behaviour.

Customers should be able to apply for the card in [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) app once they become eligible. Hence at this point of time, all you can do is to wait patiently for the invitation.

#### Fees

[Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) First credit card comes with an annual fee of Rs. 500 charged at the end of year. However these charges can be waived if you spend Rs. 50,000 in a year.

#### Rewards

This card will provide a flat 1% cashback on all spends without any restrictions. The cashback will be auto-credited to the card account every month. Also customers will be awarded [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) promo-codes worth Rs 10,000 on spending a minimum of Rs 10,000 on the credit card within the first four months of issuance.

#### Features

Given that this is a co-branded card entry level card, the extra features are minimal. Below are some of them:

- Contactless enabled card
- International acceptance
- Attractive Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) options
- Seamless integration with [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) app for viewing transactions
- Real time offers visibility on [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) First Card passbook inside [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) app
- Exclusive offers on dining, shopping & travel using Citi Privileges platform

#### Bottomline

This card is mainly targeted for beginners who would like to have a simplified reward program and low annual charges. Comparing [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) First Credit Card with [Amazon Pay ICICI Bank credit card](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/), latter wins hands down in my opinion. However this card is still better than many other entry level cards owing to higher reward rate of 1%.
