Paytm in collaboration with Citi Bank launched Paytm First Credit Card in India today. It is a co-branded card issued on Visa network. This is a entry level lifestyle card with low joining fee and simplified reward rate.

#### Eligibility Criteria

Citi and Paytm have jointly developed a selection tool which will identify the potential user base for Paytm First credit card. This will help those users immensely who don't have a credit history as Paytm First card will be offered based on an individual's digital behaviour.

Customers should be able to apply for the card in Paytm app once they become eligible. Hence at this point of time, all you can do is to wait patiently for the invitation.

#### Fees

Paytm First credit card comes with an annual fee of Rs. 500 charged at the end of year. However these charges can be waived if you spend Rs. 50,000 in a year.

#### Rewards

This card will provide a flat 1% cashback on all spends without any restrictions. The cashback will be auto-credited to the card account every month. Also customers will be awarded Paytm promo-codes worth Rs 10,000 on spending a minimum of Rs 10,000 on the credit card within the first four months of issuance.

#### Features

Given that this is a co-branded card entry level card, the extra features are minimal. Below are some of them:

- Contactless enabled card
- International acceptance
- Attractive Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) options
- Seamless integration with Paytm app for viewing transactions
- Real time offers visibility on Paytm First Card passbook inside Paytm app
- Exclusive offers on dining, shopping & travel using Citi Privileges platform

#### Bottomline

This card is mainly targeted for beginners who would like to have a simplified reward program and low annual charges. Comparing Paytm First Credit Card with [Amazon Pay ICICI Bank credit card](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/), latter wins hands down in my opinion. However this card is still better than many other entry level cards owing to higher reward rate of 1%.
