HDFC Bank Regalia Credit Card was my primary driver, before I switched to [Yes First Exclusive Credit Card](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/). I was able to acquire Yes First Exclusive Credit Card owing to generous credit limit of HDFC Bank Regalia Credit Card. I still use this card for 10X rewards on SmartBuy when I have exhausted the monthly limit of bonus reward points on my [HDFC Bank Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/).
