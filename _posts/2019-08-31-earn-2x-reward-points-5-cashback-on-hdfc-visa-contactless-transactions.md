Visa in order to promote contactless transactions has collaborated with HDFC Bank to provide offers on their credit and debit cards. Earlier this year, Visa launched a [similar offer](/10-cashback-on-contactless-transactions-with-visa-sbi-credit-cards/) in partnership with SBI Credit Cards. Those who are not aware, a transaction of up to Rs. 2,000 can be made by tapping on contactless enabled POS terminals without entering the PIN.

### Bottomline

This offer translates to a reward rate of 2.6% for Regalia and 6.6% for Infinia card holders which is decent. However a low maximum cap on rewards is little disappointing. Also this offer is applicable only on Visa cards and hence cards issued on Mastercard and Diners Club platform don't qualify for this offer.
