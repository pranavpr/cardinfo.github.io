IndusInd Bank rolled out an exclusive offer on their Amex variant of cards wherein top spending card members can win Amazon vouchers. However there are certain nuances about this offer which make it little underwhelming. Let's dive into the details to know more.

### Bottomline

I was informed about this offer on my [IndusInd Iconia Amex credit card](/indusind-iconia-american-express-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"}
via an email. However I generally don't like offers like these wherein top spenders are only considered for reward. The main reason for the same being lack of transparency. One can never know if they have spent enough to be in top spenders.

Given that Amex rolled out multiple offers on their cards recently, I believe it wanted to please partner bank card members too and hence the offer. This is a welcome move and I expect some more exclusive offers on Amex variant of cards from other banks too.
