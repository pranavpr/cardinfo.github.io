American Express, in order to streamline the offers on it's cards, has rolled out Amex Offers section in it's online portal. This section is available just below the transactions section and lists all offers applicable on that card.

To view the new offers section, login to [Amex website](https://www.americanexpress.com/in/) and scroll down to bottom to see the Amex Offers section. You can also directly navigate to Amex Offers section by clicking [here](https://global.americanexpress.com/offers/eligible). The new section lists all offers as shown below:

### Bottomline

This feature was already available for Amex card in USA since 2018 and launching the same in India is a welcome move by Amex. Earlier, one has to check email for offers and enroll in to them using a web form. Often one would miss the email or forget to enroll. The new Amex offers section provides all offers applicable to card at one place and convenience to enroll in them by just one click.

If you don't have Amex, you can get [American Express Membership Rewards Credit Card](/american-express-membership-rewards-credit-card-mrcc-review/) for **free** using my referral link below:
