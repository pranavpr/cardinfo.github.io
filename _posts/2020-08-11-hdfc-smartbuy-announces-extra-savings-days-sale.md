### Bottomline

This is a terrific offer from HDFC Bank which enables you to get extra 10% discount over and above [SmartBuy 10X program](https://cardinfo.in/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/){:target="\_blank"}. With this, the overall reward rate for travel and instant vouchers pushes to 43% (33% SmartBuy 10X Program + 10% this offer) for [Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} credit cards which is quite amazing. However the low limit of discount up to Rs. 500 is a huge let down and kills all the joy. I am definitely going to utilize this offer for purchasing instant vouchers on SmartBuy to get the extra benefit.

**PS:** Thanks [Abin](https://cardinfo.in/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/#commento-627031932838a95d925adc5a67f2b8a247f5479cd9feee96b944b613ec85b9b7){:target="\_blank"} for sharing the offer T&C.
