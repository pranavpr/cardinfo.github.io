HDFC Bank has devalued the reward points for their super premium credit cards, [Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/) and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/), for cash redemptions by 40%. HDFC Bank enabled the [redemption of reward points for cash](/redeem-hdfc-credit-card-reward-points-for-cash/) last year to cater the customers who don't travel a lot. This devaluation comes as a shock to many as HDFC Bank took this step without informing the customers in advance. Let's look into the details of this devaluation.

### Reward Point Value

Below table summarizes the current and previous value of 1 reward point of Infinia and Diners Club Black Credit Cards when redeemed for cash.

<table class="table" style="display: block;overflow-x: auto;">

    <th scope="col"> Credit Card</th>

	<td> Rs. 0.30 </td>
    <td> Rs. 0.50 </td>
    <td> 40% </td>

The cash redemption value of other premium credit cards' reward points remain intact as illustrated below:

### Bottomline

HDFC Bank is bleeding a lot with [10X Rewards Program](/hdfc-bank-10x-rewards-program-february-2020-update/) and this seems to be a measure to control it. The 40% devaluation overnight is a huge shocker and I wish HDFC Bank should have informed the customers in advance about this change. I really appreciate Amex for their transparency as they inform customers in advance about the [devaluations](/amex-gold-collection-introduction-of-taj-vouchers-devaluation-for-amazon-vouchers-statement-credit/).

The redemption value of other premium credit cards' reward points remain intact for now. I feel this is mostly because HDFC Bank has already put [restrictions on redemption of reward points](/new-restriction-on-hdfc-bank-regalia-and-diners-clubmiles-credit-card-rewards-redemption/) for these cards sometimes back. The redemption value of reward points for flights and hotels on SmartBuy is not affected for [Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/) and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) and it remains same. However HDFC Bank may already be cooking another set of devaluation/restrictions for their credit cards, who knows?
