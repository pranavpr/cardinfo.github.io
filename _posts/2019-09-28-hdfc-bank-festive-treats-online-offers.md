HDFC Bank is on roll and above online offers are indeed exciting. However, I wish they should have partnered with some more main stream e-commerce sites like [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) and [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) so that we could have enjoyed more discounts. However, note that [10X rewards program on Smartbuy](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-rewards-even-more-rewarding-with-december-2019-update/) is still active for [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) and Amazon and one can still enjoy reward rate up to 33% using Diners Club Black and Infinia Credit Cards.
