### Bottomline
 
It was a tough year for the credit card industry last year. Travel and outdoor dining being banned mostly due to COVID lockdowns, the spends on credit cards reduced significantly. Due to this, we not only witnessed the devaluation of some credit cards, but also reduction in launches of new credit cards. However as the situation normalizes and spends on credit cards picks up, we can expect some exciting credit card launches this year.
 
To reap maximum benefits, you may get multiple credit cards. However make sure you have a strategy in place to reap the maximum benefits out of them.
Also don't apply for multiple credit cards in short span of time, it may hamper your credit [(CIBIL) score](/cibil-scoring-algorithm-update-2020-everything-you-need-to-know/){:target="\_blank"} as lenders will see you credit hungry. Spread out the applications over a period of time to lower the impact and one application per 6 months is a good place to start.
