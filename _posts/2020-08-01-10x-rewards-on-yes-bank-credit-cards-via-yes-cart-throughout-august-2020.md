Note that the reward rate for [Yes First Exclusive](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"}, Yes First Preferred and Yes Prima varies between two values as 1 RP = Rs. 0.25 if you redeem for travel and 1 RP = Rs. 0.15 if you redeem for anything else. Also the reward earning rate is different in the travel category in comparison to other categories for [Yes First Exclusive](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and Yes First Preferred.

Overall this seems to be a great offer for Yes Private, [Yes First Exclusive](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and Yes First Preferred cards holders. However to get the maximum value, spends should be made on the travel category and redeemed for the travel category itself which seems little difficult in current times. Also the maximum limit of 10,000 on bonus reward points is a little disappointing. I wish Yes Bank should have provided a higher cap for bonus reward points to make it even more exciting.
