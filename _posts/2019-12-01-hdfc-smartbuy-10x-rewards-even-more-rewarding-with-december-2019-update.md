### Bottomline

The new SmartBuy e-Voucher offer is a fabulous offer from HDFC Bank as it increases the reward rate of HDFC Bank credit cards by flat 10%. Best part is there is, though there is maximum cap on reward point per transaction, there is no maximum cap on rewards and number of transactions. Hence one can make multiple transactions above Rs. 3,000 to get maximum benefit. I am summarizing the approximate rewards for some popular HDFC Bank Credit Cards below:

<sup>‡</sup> Cumulative value of 10X Reward Points and SmartBuy e-Voucher

Needless to say, HDFC Bank has become hyper-aggressive these days and upping the game in Credit Card market steadily. The launch of [new benefits on HDFC Diners Club Black credit card](/hdfc-bank-introduces-new-benefits-on-diners-club-black-credit-card/), [10X rewards on gift vouchers](/10x-rewards-on-gift-vouchers-using-hdfc-bank-credit-cards/) and [Multiple exciting merchant offers](/hdfc-bank-festive-treats-partner-merchant-offers/): HDFC Bank is not leaving a single chance for it's competitors.

The 43% reward rate on Infinia and Diners Club Black is insane and I don't see a reason for not cashing in this opportunity. HDFC Bank is pushing hard to make SmartBuy portal a one stop shop for all online shopping needs. However, I have serious doubts on sustainability of this offer and only time will tell about the longevity of this program. Till then keep reaping the benefits!

**Update:** HDFC Bank has extended the 10X Program till end of January 2020 and added another partner. Read about the latest offering of this program in [January 2020 update](/hdfc-smartbuy-january-2020-update-10x-rewards-on-oyo-rooms/).
