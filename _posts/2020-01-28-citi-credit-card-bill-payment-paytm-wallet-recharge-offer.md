### Bottomline

This is a decent offer from Citi Bank and provides a reward rate of 2% on bill payment and 2.5% on wallet recharge. Though the offer on bill payment is underwhelming, the offer on wallet recharge is really exciting. You can recharge your [Paytm](https://l.cardinfo.in/paytm) wallet twice: once in January and once in February to get a total cashback of Rs. 100. Personally I have never seen a cashback offer on wallet recharge and this is certainly new to me.
