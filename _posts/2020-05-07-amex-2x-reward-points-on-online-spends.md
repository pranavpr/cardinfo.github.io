Amex recently launched [double rewards offer](/amex-double-rewards-offer-2x-points-2x-value-on-amex-platinum-card/){:target="\_blank"} on Amex Platinum Card and a similar offer was expected on other cards too. Amex didn't disappoint the card members and rolled out this offer on Platinum Reserve, Platinum Travel and Jet Airways Platinum Credit Card. Let's look in to the details to know more.

### Bottomline

This is a decent offer from Amex and to maximize the benefit you need to spend Rs. 50,000 on American Express Platinum Reserve and American Express Platinum Travel Card and Rs. 18,750 on Jet Airways American Express Platinum Credit Card. However personally I feel Amex could have done better by rolling out the [Double Value Offer](https://cardinfo.in/amex-double-rewards-offer-2x-points-2x-value-on-amex-platinum-card/#double-value-offer){:target="\_blank"} on these cards too to make this offer even better.

Also Amex Gold and [Membership Rewards Credit Card](/american-express-membership-rewards-credit-card-mrcc-review/){:target="\_blank"} are excluded from this offer which is utterly disappointing. I hope Amex will roll out a similar offer on these cards too very soon.
