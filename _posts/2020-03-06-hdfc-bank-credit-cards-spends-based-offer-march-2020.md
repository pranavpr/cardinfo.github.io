### Bottomline

I received Offer 2 on my [Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) wherein I have to spend Rs. 52,000 to get a voucher of Rs. 2,500. This translates to an additional reward rate of 4.8% which is decent. With default reward rate of 3.3% of Diners Club Black, the overall reward rate shoots to 8.1% which is quite amazing.
