### Bottomline

5% cashback on highway toll is really a good offer. If you spend less Rs. 2,000 per month on highway tolls, you should be able to get maximum value out of this offer. FASTag really adds convenience to your travel and you can save the precious time which you spend waiting in queue at toll plaza for cash counters. I don't see any reason to not use this offer.
