HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card is undoubtedly [best credit card](/best-credit-cards-of-2019-in-india/) in India at the moment and getting hands on it is dream of every credit card enthusiast. The 3.3% default reward rate which can accelerate to 33% using [10X Rewards program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-rewards-even-more-rewarding-with-december-2019-update/), 2X rewards on dining, no pre-set spending limit are some droolworthy features of this card.

I recently upgraded to [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/) and in this article I'd be talking about my relationship with HDFC Bank, upgrade process, unboxing experience and tips for getting invited for Infinia.

### Background

I started my relationship with HDFC Bank 11 years back when I opened my salary account with them in year 2008 at the start of my career. At same time, HDFC Bank issued me my first credit card and my journey towards Infinia started.

I moved through Visa Gold, Visa Platinum Plus, Visa Signature, Regalia to finally reach Infinia during a span of 11 years. During initial years I was automatically upgraded and my credit limit was enhanced as HDFC credit card was my primary driver. However in 2017, I got hold of [Yes First Exclusive Credit Card](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/) along with American Express Gold card and shifted my spends there. I believe it was a mistake as if I would have continued using my Regalia, I would have gotten an upgrade to Infinia sooner. Eventually at the start of this year, I started the pursue of Infinia and shifted some of my spends to Regalia. And in 9 months, I got an upgrade to Infinia.

### Upgrade Process

One day, while casually going through HDFC Net Banking, I checked the credit card upgrade option for my Regalia Credit Card which had a credit limit of around 10 Lakh. I met with a shock when I saw the upgrade option to Infinia from Regalia available to me.

The card was being offered first year free and annual fee of Rs. 10,000 which can be waived off on spends of Rs. 8 Lakhs. The credit limit offered was same as Regalia Card with a reward conversion rate of 50% which was fair. Without a second thought, I applied for the upgrade.

### Unboxing

I received the physical card on fourth day after applying for upgrade online via BlueDart. The card came in a beautiful cardboard box with Infinia branding.

The box contained primary and add-on credit cards and the corresponding Priority Pass cards along with the welcome letter. I received the Visa Infinite version of the card, as I believe, my previous card Regalia, was also on Visa platform.

The design of the Infinia is similar to Regalia with with only difference being color of card and embossed markings. The card number and name along with other details are embossed in golden color. The card has the artwork in blue and black colors.

Overall the design is just okayish and nothing extra ordinary. The card doesn't give the super premium feel which is expected from cards in this segment.

### Getting Approved

Getting approved is the most tricky part for Infinia. I have a preferred account with HDFC Bank which comes with a perk (?) of relationship manager (RM). I have constantly been asking my RM for an upgrade to Infinia, but he denied my request saying I'll automatically get an invite if I become eligible. Hence, in my case, RM was useless and he didn't help at all. However, from my experience, following will help a lot in getting Infinia:

- Long relationship with HDFC Bank
- Existing credit card with limit in range of Rs. 8 to 10 Lakhs
- Regular and high spends on existing credit card (I spent around 6 Lakhs on my Regalia in 9 Months)
- Monthly in-hand salary > Rs. 3.75 Lakhs for salaried
- ITR > 45 Lakhs for self employed
- High NRV (investments in Fixed Deposits, Life Insurance, Home Loan, Mutual Funds etc., though I don't have any of these with HDFC)

### Bottomline

There is no shortcut to receive the [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/). Once needs to be patient working slowly and steadily towards Infinia. It took me 11 Years to reach Infinia from Visa Gold Card, but I did reach eventually. Hence, if you really want this card, keep increasing your NRV with HDFC Bank and keep spending on your existing HDFC Bank Credit Card.
