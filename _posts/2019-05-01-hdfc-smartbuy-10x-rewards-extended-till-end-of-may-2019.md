HDFC 10X Reward Points program on [Smartbuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com) portal has been further extended till 31 May 2019. This is undoubtedly one of the best credit card reward program providing up to 33% back if you hold HDFC Infinia or Diners Club Black credit card.

### Offer Details

- 10X Reward Points on HDFC Bank Credit Cards
- 10% Cashback on HDFC Debit Cards
- This covers Flights, Hotels, [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart)/[Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) and Compare & Shop on [Smartbuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com)

- [Terms & Conditions](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/offer_details/409)

### Maximum Cap

- 25,000 Reward Points on Credit Cards
- Rs. 1000/- cashback on Debit Cards

### Fulfillment

- Reward Points or Cashback will be posted within 90 working days from the last date of transaction month.

### Bottomline

HDFC has certainly surprised me by extending the program further by a month. Last month HDFC reduced the reward to 5X, but later on reinstated the 10X. This made me think that 10X era is coming to an end and HDFC will give only 5X starting next month. However this is not the case and 10X continues through May 2019.
