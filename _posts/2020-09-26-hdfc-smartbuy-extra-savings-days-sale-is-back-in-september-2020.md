### Bottomline

This is a nice offer from HDFC Bank, especially for shopping on Amazon wherein [Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} credit card holders can enjoy 10X reward points equivalent to 33% reward rate. Note that the maximum cap on bonus rewards points is still governed by the regular maximum monthly limit as outlined [here](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-major-devaluation-from-june-2020/){:target="\_blank"}. A 10% discount on instant vouchers is also nice, however a low limit on maximum discount of Rs. 250 is little disheartening.

It's interesting to see that HDFC Bank has come up with new clause for new users. I am not sure if the discount code worth Rs. 250 on SmartBuy Instant Vouchers is in addition to above benefits or this is the only benefit new users will get. We will have to wait till the sale goes live to find out.

HDFC ran a similar [offer](/hdfc-smartbuy-announces-extra-savings-days-sale/){:target="\_blank"} last month with better max cap on discounts for Instant Vouchers. However the Gyftr site was not able to handle the load and many users were not able to login and make the purchase. I hope HDFC Bank and Gyftr have taken precautions on not repeating the disaster of last month.

Overall I liked the offer and will definitely utilize this offer for instant vouchers and Amazon purchases.
