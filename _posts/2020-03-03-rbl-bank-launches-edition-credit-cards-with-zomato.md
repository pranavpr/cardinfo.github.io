RBL Bank in partnership with Zomato launched Edition Credit Cards on 2 March 2020. Edition Credit Cards come in two variants: Normal and Classic and are available on MasterCard platform. While these credit cards provide a reward rate of 5%-10% on dining, the base reward rate varies between 1%-2%. These credit cards also provide complimentary annual membership of Zomato Gold.

These credit cards provide rewards in the form of Edition Cash which can be used on Zomato for ordering food or paying at restaurants. Each Edition Point is equivalent to Re. 1 on the Zomato app. Let's dive into the details to know about the features and offerings of these credit cards.

### RBL Edition Classic Credit Card

RBL Edition Classic Credit Card is the base variant of the card which has complimentary annual Zomato Gold membership, valid in a city. This card has relatively lower fees and thus limited features when compared with premium variant.

- **Annual Fee:** Rs. 500 + GST
- **Eligibility:**
  - Age: 25 years to 60 Years
  - Income: Net Monthly Income >= Rs. 25,000
- **Welcome Benefit:**
  - 500 Edition Cash, ~ Rs. 500
  - Complimentary annual Zomato Gold City Membership, worth Rs. 600
- **Reward Rate:**
  - 5 Edition Cash on every Rs. 100 spent on dining, 5% reward rate
  - 1.5 Edition Cash on every Rs. 100 spent online, 1.5% reward rate
  - 1 Edition Cash on every Rs. 100 spent everywhere else, 1% reward rate
- **Milestone Benefits:**
  - 2,000 Edition Cash worth Rs. 2,000 on spending Rs. 2,00,000 every year

One thing to note is that there is no spend based annual fee waiver for this card which is a little disappointing.

### RBL Edition Credit Card

RBL Edition Credit Card is a premium variant of the card and comes with relatively higher annual fees and better features. Even the Zomato Gold membership provided with this card is valid not only in India, but internationally too.

- **Annual Fee:** Rs. 3,000 + GST
  - Waived off on spending more than Rs. 2,50,000 in the preceding year
- **Eligibility:**
  - Age: 25 years to 60 Years
  - Income: Net Monthly Income >= Rs. 25,000
- **Welcome Benefit:**
  - Complimentary annual Zomato Gold Global Membership worth Rs. 2,000
- **Reward Rate:**
  - 10 Edition Cash on every Rs. 100 spent on dining, 10% reward rate
  - 2 Edition Cash on every Rs. 100 spent online, 2% reward rate
  - 1 Edition Cash on every Rs. 100 spent everywhere else, 1% reward rate
- **Airport Lounge Access:**
  - Domestic: 2 per quarter
  - International: 2 per year using Priority Pass
- **Other benefits:**
  - Low forex markup of 1.5%
  - Buy 1 and get 1 movie ticket free at BookMyShow limited to Rs. 200, once every month
- **Milestone Benefits:**
  - 2,000 Edition Cash worth Rs. 2,000 on spending Rs. 5,00,000 every year

RBL Edition Credit Card doesn't provide welcome Edition Cash to compensate for the annual fee. However the Edition Cash earned on this card can be redeemed for statement credit which is not possible for Classic variant of the card. Airport lounge access and low forex markup makes this card an attractive choice for frequent travelers.

### Bottomline

RBL Edition Credit Card is really a good value proposition if you dine out a lot. The 10% reward rate on dining is simply amazing. Coupled with airport lounge access and low forex markup, this card can act as a travel card. Buy 1 Get 1 on BookMyShow is enticing for movie buffs too.

On the other hand, RBL Edition Classic Credit Card has really limited features and doesn't excite much. Limitation to redeem Edition Cash only on Zomato app makes it very restrictive. I wouldn't recommend this card to anyone solely due to lack of features and limitations.

In a nutshell, the RBL Edition Credit Card is the only one worth considering. If you dine out a lot and travel internationally even once annually, this card is worth it.
