American Express (Amex) is refreshing the 18 Karat and 24 Karat Gold Collection starting 1 February 2020. With this change, Amex has introduced Taj Vouchers as a redemption option under 18K and 24K Gold Collection. Along with this, it has also devalued the Membership Reward Points for redemption against Amazon voucher and Statement Credit.

{% include faq.html question="What is American Express (Amex) Gold Collection?" answer= "Gold Collection is a special reward catalog for certain American Express cards like Amex Gold Card and Amex Membership Rewards Credit Card which enable redemption of 18,000 and 24,000 Membership Reward Points for higher value. These options include statement credit, Amazon vouchers, travel vouchers, Tanishq vouchers etc. These options almost double the value of Amex Membership Reward Points and hence are very popular among the card holders." %}

Let's look into the new changes announced by American Express in detail.

### Bottomline
 
Introduction of Taj Vouchers is a fantastic move by Amex and it will please those who like Taj properties. Redemption of reward points for Taj Vouchers fetches a value of Rs. 0.58 per Membership Reward Point which is quite amazing. However it's also evident that Amex doesn't want you to redeem reward points for statement credits and [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) vouchers. The value if reward points in case of [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) voucher plummets to Rs. 0.38 per Membership Reward Point which is 34% depreciation compared to Taj Vouchers.
 
Note that these changes go in effect from 1 February 2020 and hence you have 3 days to redeem reward points at the current rate. I just redeemed my reward points for Amazon vouchers and the vouchers were emailed to me instantly.
