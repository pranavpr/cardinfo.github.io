### Bottomline

With this new addition, [HDFC Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-upgrade-experience/) and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) card holders can get a reward rate of whooping 33% on train ticket bookings. HDFC Regalia, Diners Club Privilege and ClubMiles card members can also enjoy a decent reward rate of 13% on train ticket bookings.

HDFC Bank has become really aggressive towards SmartBuy portal as it's been adding multiple partners/options recently. Last month only HDFC Bank added [option for purchasing Gift Cards](/10x-rewards-on-gift-vouchers-using-hdfc-bank-credit-cards/) on SmartBuy portal in partnership with Gyftr extending the benefit of 10X program to many merchants/brands. Also with [December update to 10X Program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-rewards-even-more-rewarding-with-december-2019-update/), HDFC Bank is providing additional 10% rewards on transacting at SmartBuy portal. Now with introduction of train ticket booking, it's quite apparent that HDFC Bank is pretty serious about SmartBuy portal and I expect more enhancements/offerings on this platform.
