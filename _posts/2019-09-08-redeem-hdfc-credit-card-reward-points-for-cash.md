HDFC Bank has enabled the redemption of reward points on their credit cards towards cash. This redemption will be posted as statement credit to the card holders account.

### Reward Point Value

The reward points of different HDFC Bank credit cards are valued differently and hence their conversion rate to cash is also different. Value of one reward point for redemption against cash and travel of some popular HDFC Credit Cards is summarized below:

<table class="table" style="display: block;overflow-x: auto;">
<thead class="thead-dark">
<tr>
    <th scope="col"> Credit Card</th>
	<th scope="col"> Cash</th>
    <th scope="col"> Travel</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td> HDFC Infinia </td>
	<td> <s>Rs. 0.50</s> Rs. 0.30 </td>
    <td> Rs. 1 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> HDFC Diners Club Black </td>
	<td> <s>Rs. 0.50</s> Rs. 0.30 </td>
    <td> Rs. 1 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> HDFC Regalia </td>
	<td> Rs. 0.20 </td>
    <td> Rs. 0.50 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> HDFC Diners Club ClubMiles</td>
	<td> Rs. 0.20 </td>
    <td> Rs. 0.50 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> HDFC Regalia First</td>
	<td> Rs. 0.20 </td>
    <td> Rs. 0.30 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It's quite evident from above table that points are devalued by more than 50% if redeemed for cash than travel.

### How to redeem?

To redeem reward points for cash, follow the instructions below:

1. Login to HDFC Net Banking
2. Go to Card → Enquire → Redeem Reward Points → Select Card → Continue
3. On HDFC MyReward portal go to Redeem Reward Points → Cash Redemption
4. Enter the points to redeem and click on Proceed
5. You will get a conformation and expect the cash credit to reflect in your card account in ~7 working days.

{% include tip.html tip="Minimum redemption value should be Rs. 500 and Rs. 99 would be charged as convenience fee per redemption." %}

### Bottomline

This is a wonderful move by HDFC Bank and if you are not a frequent traveller, you can redeem your points for cash rather than unwanted gift cards. This would be also helpful in case reward points are expiring and there is no plan for travel in near future. Some value of expiring reward points can be salvaged by redeeming them for cash instantly.

However this shouldn't be primary means of redemption of reward points as it reduces their value by more than 50%. Holders of premium credit cards like Infinia, Diners Club Black, Regalia and Diners ClubMiles should definitely refrain from redeeming their points for cash.

**Update:** HDFC Bank has devalued the reward points of Infinia and Diners Club Black Credit Card for cash redemption. Read the details [here](/hdfc-bank-devalues-infinia-and-diners-club-black-reward-points-for-cash-redemption/).
