### Bottomline

This is a nice offer from HDFC Bank and it certainly sweetens the festive shopping during Christmas and New Year's eve. However restricting it to in-store purchases is a bummer. Also, as usual, HDFC Bank has made this offer available to certain segment of customer based on their discretion.
I wish HDFC Bank should have rolled out this offer to all customers, instead of restricting it to a certain set.
