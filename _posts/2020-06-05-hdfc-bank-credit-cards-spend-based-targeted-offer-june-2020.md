          You can do couple of things:
          <ul><li>Make sure your email address is listed in their marketing list. Call customer care and get yourself added if you never receive any email from informations@hdfcbank.net.</li><li>HDFC Bank sends these targeted offers to those customers whose spend is on the lesser side on HDFC credit card. Try to shift your spends to some other credit card for a few months and see if that kicks in the offer emailers.</li></ul>

### Bottomline
 
I received this offer on my [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} which I have stopped using after receiving [Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-upgrade-experience/){:target="\_blank"}. I received a spend target of Rs. 21,000 for a voucher of Rs. 1,000. Some users reported a spend target of Rs. 64,000 for a voucher worth Rs. 2,000 on [Infinia credit card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"}.
 
Overall it's a nice offer and, in my case, it translates to an incremental reward rate of 4.76% making the overall reward rate around 8% which is amazing. I am definitely going to utilize this offer to maximize the benefits.
 
**PS:** Thanks Pankaj for inputs on offers.
