Tying insurance coverage with monthly spends is something new and novel. Though most premium credit cards provide similar insurance feature complimentary, making it available to an entry level credit card by Amex is really applausable. I would strongly recommend you to enroll for this offer if you hold Membership Rewards Credit Card from Amex.
