RBL Bank has recently launched Popcorn Credit Card targeted towards movie buffs. RBL Bank Popcorn Credit Card is an entry level card which provides two free movie tickets each month on meeting the monthly spend criteria. This card also provides surprise cashback each week on meeting the weekly spend criteria.

RBL Bank already has a movie card in partnership with [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow) called [RBL Bank Movies & More Credit Card](/rbl-bank-movies-more-earlier-fun-plus-credit-card-review/) which was earlier known as RBL Bank Fun+ Credit Card. The only major difference between the two is lower monthly spend threshold for movie vouchers on the new card.

### Eligibility Criteria

RBL Bank has not disclosed any specific eligibility criteria for this credit card and it seems itâ€™s open for all individuals with age between 21 to 65 years. Obviously a good credit score and stable monthly income is required for easy approval of the card.

### Fees

RBL Bank Popcorn Credit Card comes with following fees:

- Joining fee: Rs. 1,000 + GST
- Renewal fee: Rs. 1,000 + GST

Renewal Fee is reversed second year onwards on crossing spends of Rs. 50,000 in the previous billing year.

### Features

RBL Bank Popcorn Credit Card is targeted solely for avid movie goers. Hence the features are also tailored to attract them.

#### Welcome benefits

- 4 movie tickets worth Rs. 250 each at [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow)

[BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow) vouchers worth Rs. 1,000 are provided which can be redeemed in 2 transactions of Rs. 500 each and maximum of 2 tickets in each transaction. It's quite clear that RBL Bank compensates the joining fee of the card by these vouchers.

#### Monthly Vouchers

- 2 free movie tickets worth Rs. 250 each at [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow) on monthly spends of Rs. 5,000

This is really a good value proposition and translates to a reward rate of 10% on spending Rs. 5,000 per month.

Monthly vouchers can be redeemed directly on [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow) website by selecting "RBL Bank Monthly Offer" option in "Unlock offers or Apply Promocodes". The amount is deducted instantly based on your offer and you can proceed to pay the discounted amount using RBL Bank Popcorn Credit Card. Also there is no quota and you should be able to redeem the offer against any movie at any time given seats are available.

#### Weekly Cashback

- Get surprise cashback up to Rs. 250 every week, with assured cashback of Rs. 25, on weekly spends of Rs. 2,500

This is something new and unique and based on your luck, your reward rate can range from 1% to 10% on spends up to Rs. 2,500. The reward rate will diminish further if you spend more than Rs. 2,500 per week.

To receive cashback, you have to scan the QR code at the back of the card and provide your mobile number, last 4 digits of the card and OTP. The cashback would be posted directly to card account within 2 days.

#### Other Benefits

- Fuel surcharge waiver at any petrol pump in India up to Rs. 100 each month, applicable on transactions between Rs. 500 and Rs. 4,000

### Drawbacks

RBL Bank Popcorn Credit Card, though a interesting proposition, lacks some desirable features as below:

- No reward points on spends
- No incremental reward on spends higher than Rs. 10,000 per month
- No airport lounge access
- Average customer support

Their customer support is a big concern and their support lines are always busy. Once, I had to report a fraudulent transaction on my credit card and I was able to speak to a human only after holding the line for 15 minutes. Their email response is also very slow and RBL Bank definitely needs to work on this aspect to make it better.

### Verdict

RBL Bank Popcorn Credit Card can be a good secondary card for movie buffs. This card can't be a primary driver due to lack of incremental rewards on spends higher than Rs. 10,000 in a month. Two movie tickets per month on spending just Rs. 5,000 is incredible. However, if you are not in to movies, I'd advise to stay away from this card.
