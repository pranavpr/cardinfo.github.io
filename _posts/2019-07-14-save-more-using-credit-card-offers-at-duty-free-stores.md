### Bottomline

With more people traveling internationally now, card companies don't want to lose on heavy volume of transactions on duty free stores. Hence they are trying to tap this opportunity aggressively. I foresee an increase in number of such offers by card companies in future. Also I couldn't find any card offer for Bangalore Duty Free Stores which is quite strange.

_What do you think of these offers? Are you aware of more such offers? Let me know in comments below._
