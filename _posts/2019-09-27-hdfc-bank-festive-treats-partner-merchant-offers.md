These offers on partner merchants are somewhat underwhelming and I feel HDFC should have come up with better cashback and discounts. Most of these offers have been running for long time and there is nothing special about them.

**Update**: HDFC Bank has added few more online merchants to Festive Treats offer. Read about them [here](/hdfc-bank-festive-treats-online-offers/).
