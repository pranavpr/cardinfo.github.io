### Bottomline

This is a nice offer from ICICI Bank, however the forex markup kills the joy. All international transactions on Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card accrue a forex markup of 3.5% + GST which finally sums up to 4.13%. Using this offer, card members can get a net reward rate of 0.87% which is not bad. Also it's worthwhile to note that for the first time, ICICI Bank has rolled out an offer specifically on Amazon Pay Credit Card and has excluded it's all other cards. This card is one of the [best lifestyle credit cards](/best-credit-cards-of-2019-in-india/) currently and I hope to see many more such specific offers on [Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/) in future.
