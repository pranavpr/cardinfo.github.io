### Bottomline

I received this offer on my IndusInd Aura Platinum Credit Card and since I don't use this card much, my targets are Rs. 20,000, Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 80,000 for Level 1, 2 and 3 respectively. This offer translates to a overall reward rate of **2.76%** for me if I spend Rs. 80,000 as shown below:

    <td> 200 </td>
  	<td> Rs. 340 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000 </td>
  	<td> 200 </td>
    <td> 400 </td>
  	<td> Rs. 510 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 80,000 </td>
  	<td> 400 </td>
    <td> 1200 </td>
  	<td> Rs. 1,360 </td>

    <td> </td>
    <td colspan="2"> <strong>Total value of reward points</strong> </td>
  	<td> <strong>Rs. 2,210</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

This is a decent offer I believe and option to redeem reward points for cash credit it surely lucrative. However I would be skipping this as my [HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) gives a default reward rate of 3.3% which can accelerate to 33% utilizing [10X program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-rewards-even-more-rewarding-with-december-2019-update/).
