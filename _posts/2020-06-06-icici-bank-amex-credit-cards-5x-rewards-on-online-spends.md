Note that ICICI Coral Credit Card by default provides 4 Payback points per Rs. 100 spent online making its reward rate equivalent to Emeralde. Also the cap of 5,000 reward points per month is on bonus reward points i.e. 4X reward points not on entire reward points earned.
 
3.75%-5% reward rate is really attractive and I would recommend ICIC Bank Amex credit card holders to utilize this offer to the fullest. I expect similar kinds of offers on Amex cards from other banks, e.g., [IndusInd Iconia Amex Credit Card](/indusind-iconia-american-express-credit-card-review/), too.
