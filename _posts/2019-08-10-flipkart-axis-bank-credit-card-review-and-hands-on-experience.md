### Features

Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card, though a entry level lifestyle card, packs a punch of features which are not common in this category.

#### Welcome Benefits

Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card comes with joining and activations benefits of worth Rs. 3,300.

- Rs. 500 worth Flipkart vouchers on your first transaction within 30 days of card issuance
- Gaana Plus membership for 6 months, 50% off for the next 6 months subscription
- Rs. 500 off on domestic hotel on [Goibibo](https://l.cardinfo.in/goibibo) and [MakeMyTrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/makemytrip) on a minimum booking of Rs. 2,000
- 15% cashback up to Rs. 500 on first transaction on Myntra
- 20% instant discount up to Rs. 400 for new Urban Clap customers

Rs. 500 [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) voucher evens out the Rs. 500 joining fee which is great. However, I feel, other welcome offers are gimmicky and are just to inflate the welcome offerings.

#### Rewards

Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card comes with unlimited cashback which would be credited to card account three days before statement generation. The cashback rate is multi-tiered based on merchants and is summarized below:

	<td> 1.5% </td>

</tbody>
</table>

This credit card really shines in this department and 1.5% default reward rate gives competition to some super premium credit cards like [Yes First Exclusive Credit Card](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/).

#### Airport Lounge Access

- 4 complementary Domestic Airport Lounge access per year using [Mastercard India Lounge Program](https://specials.priceless.com/en-in/offers/Mastercard_India_Lounge_Program?Oid=201902180040)

Airport Lounge access is uncommon for credit cards in this segment and I really appreciate [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) and Axis Bank for making it available on this card. You can easily even out renewal fee on this card from second year onwards by visiting the airport lounge just once in a year.

#### Other benefits

- 1% fuel surcharge waiver on transactions between Rs. 400 and Rs. 4000
- 20% off at restaurants participating in [Dining Delights](https://diningdelights.axisbank.com/) program
- Convert purchases over Rs. 2,000 to EMI

### Drawbacks

Though Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card is a fantastic lifestyle credit card, there are some downsides too.

- No waiver of renewal fee on meeting annual spend criteria like other credit cards
- No seamless online process for applying and getting the card as of now. However, it seems [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) & Axis Bank are working on the same and are claiming to have a virtual card issued in 3 minutes (!) in coming future.

### Experience

I got Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card by upgrading from Axis Bank My Zone credit card. I called the customer care and placed a request for upgrade of my old card to Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card. I was assured that my card would be issued in 7 days and same would be delivered within 7 days of issuance. After couple of days, I got an SMS from Axis Bank stating my Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card has been issued. I was able to see the new card along with old card in Axis Mobile app post that. However there was no way to see the card details and hence it was of no use. After 5 days, the physical card was delivered to my address.

The envelope just contained the welcome letter, with card affixed on it, without any other documentation which was little strange to me. The credit limit and cash withdrawal limit provided was equal to my previous card. I immediately set the PIN using Axis Mobile app and the experience was seamless. Afterwards I did a small online transaction to check if the card was active and the transaction went through as expected.

Overall I had pleasant experience in acquiring this card. I believe this was mainly due to the fact that I upgraded and existing card to this card.

### Verdict

The default reward rate of 1.5% on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card is best in it's segment right now and statement credit of cash back is cherry on the cake. Access to domestic airport lounges is another great feature which comes in handy during travel.

This card is ideal for first timers owing to it's simplified reward program and low joining & renewal fee. I'll also recommend this card to heavy online shoppers of [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) & [Myntra](https://l.cardinfo.in/myntra) as they get maximum reward rate of 5% on this card.
