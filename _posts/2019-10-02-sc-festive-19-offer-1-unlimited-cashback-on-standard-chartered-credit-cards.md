Standard Chartered unveiled the Festive 19 offer wherein it's providing 1% unlimited cashback on credit cards.

The spend target is communicated after you register for this offer. I received following SMS on registration for my Standard Chartered Manhattan Credit Card:

> Congratulations! You have unlocked 1% Unlimited Cashback on all spends on your StanChart credit card till 31 Dec 2019. No max cap on cashback. Spend INR 15,000 or more every month in Oct, Nov and Dec to be eligible for the offer. For tnc, visit [https://bit.ly/2mYLttr](https://bit.ly/2mYLttr)

### Bottomline

Standard Chartered is decreasing rewards day by day and it's definitely now a good news. The meagre 1% reward rate is underwhelming and unattractive. Standard Chartered really needs to roll its sleeve up and start providing better offers to retain its customers. Even though the target is low for me, I am not going to avail this offer owing to it's low reward rate.
