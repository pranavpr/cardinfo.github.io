HDFC Bank has silently launched Diners Club Privilege Credit Card today. Feature wise, Diners Club Privilege Credit is placed in between [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) and Diners Club ClubMiles. This card borrows the annual membership feature from Diners Club Black and provides reward rate similar to Diners Club ClubMiles.

HDFC Bank Diners Club Privilege Credit Card borrows its design from Diners Club Black Credit Card. Only major differences being the color scheme and prominent "Privilege" marking at the front.

### Eligibility Criteria

Since Diners Club Privilege is placed a level below Diners Club Black, the income bar is relatively lower.

- Age: 21 to 60 Years for salaried, 21 to 65 Years for self employed
- Salaried: Net Monthly Income > Rs. 40,000 per month
- Self Employed: ITR > Rs. 6 Lakhs per annum

{% include tip.html tip="You have a fair chance of upgrade to HDFC Diners Club Privilege Credit Card if existing credit card limit is ~ 3 Lakhs." %}

### Fees

HDFC Diners Club Privilege Credit Card comes with following fees:

- Joining fee: Rs. 2,500 + GST
- Renewal fee: Rs. 2,500 + GST

Renewal fee is waived off if spend in previous year is more than Rs. 3 Lakhs.

### Features

HDFC Diners Club Privilege Credit Card packs a nice set of features including, but not limited to, Annual Memberships, Golf Program, Airport lounge access, Concierge etc. Let's look in to the details of each of those features.

#### Welcome & Annual Benefits

HDFC Diners Club Privilege Credit Card comes with following complimentary annual memberships:

- Zomato Gold
- Amazon Prime
- [MakeMyTrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/makemytrip) Double Black
- Times Prime

Above annual memberships are part of welcome benefits and can be availed upon completing the first transaction within the first 90 days from card open date. The welcome benefits will be communicated on HDFC bank registered Mobile Number via SMS and Email ID within 30 days from date of first transaction.

Also these memberships would be renewed for card members who achieve an annual spend milestone of Rs. 5 Lakhs at the time of card anniversary (card anniversary is 12 months from card open month). Customers eligible for annual membership benefits will be communicated on HDFC Bank registered
Mobile Number via SMS and Email ID within 30 days from the date of card anniversary.

It's quite evident that HDFC Bank is luring the card members for spending more by keeping the spending criteria for complimentary annual memberships higher than renewal fee waiver.

The discount and benefits varies across partners and more information can be found at <a href="https://hdfcbankdinersclubwellness.poshvine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.

#### Other benefits

- 15% discount at partner restaurants
- 1% cashback on international transactions using [Global Value Program](/hdfc-global-value-program-everything-you-need-to-know/) (annual fee of Rs. 199)

### Drawbacks

Though HDFC Diners Club Privilege credit card provides host of benefits and features, it has some drawbacks too:

- Limited acceptability: Though coverage of Diners Club is expanding day by day, it's not as good as Visa/Mastercard. You need to keep a backup card handy always, especially outside India.
- No renewal benefits: There are no renewal benefits if your spend is less than Rs. 3 Lakhs. I wish HDFC Bank should have compensated for renewal fees by providing reward points of equivalent value.

### Verdict

HDFC Bank Diners Club Privilege Credit Card bridges the gap between Diners Club Black and Diners Club ClubMiles. It's a good card for those who are not able to get hold of Diners Club Black. The annual memberships and golf privileges with relatively lower annual fee is certainly a welcome move. HDFC Bank has disrupted the market yet again by launching another credit card with exciting features and benefits.
