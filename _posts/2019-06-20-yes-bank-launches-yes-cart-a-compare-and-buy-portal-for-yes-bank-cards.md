Currently there are four partner merchants, _viz._, [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon), [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart), [Myntra](https://l.cardinfo.in/myntra) and Tata Cliq on Yes Cart. Shopping on these partner merchants using your Yes Bank credit and debit card will entitle you for accelerated reward points and cash back.

### How to avail the offer?

To avail this offer, you need to visit [Yes Cart](https://yescart.yesbank.in) and click on partner merchant logo where you want to do the shopping. Once you click, you will be prompted with a modal asking for first six and last four digits of your card along with registered mobile number. Then you need to click on "Submit" and then "Proceed" button (pretty bad user experience in my opinion) to be redirected to partner merchant website. Once you land on partner merchant website, add products to your cart and checkout using Yes Bank credit card. Note that you will get bonus reward points or cash back only on products that are added in the cart after being redirected from Yes Cart.

### Fulfillment

Bonus Reward Points or cash back will be credited within 90 working days from the last date of calendar month in which transaction is done.

### Bottomline

It seems, the volume of transactions on Yes Bank credit cards has reduced drastically after they [devalued their cards significantly](/yes-bank-credit-cards-rewards-reduced/). Hence they are desperately trying to increase the same by sending [spend based offers](/yes-bank-credit-card-spend-based-offers-may-2019/) and bonus reward points. However, they are not doing enough to lure customers. When compared with [HDFC SmartBuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/) portal, which provides [10X reward points and 5% cash back](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-program-revamped-and-extended-till-june-2019/), this offers stands no where.

Also their super premium credit card, Yes Private, has a maximum cap of 7,500 reward points per month which is significantly less than many lower variants. I am not sure what's the strategy of Yes Bank here. Maybe the holders of these super premium credit cards don't care about rewards and are more interested in other facilities offered on the card.

If Yes Bank really wants to gain back the volume of transactions, they need to increase the reward rate and number of partner merchants. Ability to use reward points for hotel and flight ticket bookings on Yes Cart will also help them a lot.
