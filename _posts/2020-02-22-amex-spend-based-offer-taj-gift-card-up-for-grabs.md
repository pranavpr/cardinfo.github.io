### Bottomline

I received an offer of Rs. 20,000 Taj Gift Card on spending Rs. 3 Lakhs on my [American Express Membership Rewards Credit Card (MRCC)](/american-express-membership-rewards-credit-card-mrcc-review/). This offer translates to a reward rate of 6.67% which is quite decent. One other [reader](https://cardinfo.in/amex-gold-collection-introduction-of-taj-vouchers-devaluation-for-amazon-vouchers-statement-credit/#commento-0234e29b6d1d2ff0394811d5a57f321f04b5d0981344b56daba5ba1a088724bd) has reported an offer of Rs. 50,000 Taj Gift Card on spending Rs. 7.5 Lakhs. Hence it seems, Amex has rolled out the offer to customers based on their spending pattern. It's worthwhile to note that you can club this offer with [2X rewards on educational spends](/amex-2x-membership-reward-points-on-education-spends/) to enjoy a double dip.
