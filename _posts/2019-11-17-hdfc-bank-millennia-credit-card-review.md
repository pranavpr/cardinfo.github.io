HDFC Bank [launched the millennia series in August](/hdfc-bank-millennia-cards-launched/) this year targeting the lifestyles and aspirations of millennials which constitute 34% of Indian population. HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card focuses on cashback rather than reward points to keep it simple and straightforward. This credit card provides accelerated cashback on transacting via PayZapp and SmartBuy along with better cashback on online spends.

HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card comes with a blue background and minimalistic design. The card number and expiry date are printed at back as opposed to front like other credit cards. Though the card looks decent, it lacks the premium feeling. HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card is available on MasterCard World, Visa Signature and Diners Club platforms and is enabled for contactless payments.

### Eligibility Criteria

HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card is an entry level card and hence the eligibility criteria has been framed with lower income requirements.

- Age: 21 to 60 Years for salaried, 21 to 65 Years for self employed
- Salaried: Gross Monthly Income > Rs. 25,000 per month
- Self Employed: ITR > Rs. 6 Lakhs per annum

HDFC is very strict about the eligibility criteria for issuing new cards. However, the exceptions can be made based on your current relationship with bank.

### Fees

HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card comes with following fees:

- Joining fee: Rs. 1,000 + GST
- Renewal fee: Rs. 1,000 + GST

Renewal fee is waived off if total spends in previous year is more than Rs. 1 Lakh. HDFC Bank may issue this card without a fee if you have a good standing relationship with them.

### Features

HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card packs benefits suitable for online spenders who like simple and straightforward reward system.

#### Welcome & Milestone Benefits

HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card comes with multiple welcome and milestone benefits.

- Welcome Benefit/Renewal Benefit of 1,000 Cash Points (applicable only on payment of membership fee), worth Rs. 1,000
- Rs. 1,000 worth gift vouchers on spends of Rs. 1,00,000 and above in each calendar quarter (for first year only)
- First year's membership fee waiver on spends of Rs. 30,000 and above in the first 90 days

It's quite evident that HDFC Bank compensates for joining and renewal fees by providing cashback of equivalent amount.

#### Rewards

- 5% CashBack on all spends/shopping via PayZapp and SmartBuy
  - Maximum Cashback: Rs. 750 per month
  - Launch Offer: Maximum Cashback Rs. 1,000 per month for the first six months post issuance of the card
  - Minimum Transaction: Rs. 2,000
- 2.5% CashBack on all online spends
  - Maximum Cashback: Rs. Rs. 750
  - Minimum Transaction: Rs. 2,000
- 1% CashBack on all offline spends
  - Maximum Cashback: Rs. Rs. 750
  - Minimum Transaction: Rs. 100
- Cashback will be given in form of CashPoints
  - 1 CashPoint = Rs. 1 for redemption against the statement balance, minimum 2,500 cash points required for redemption
  - 1 CashPoint = Rs. 0.30 for redemption against travel benefits on SmartBuy portal
- CashPoints will expire/lapse within 1 year of accumulation

It's evident that HDFC Bank wants you to redeem cash points against statement balance owing to higher conversion ratio than other options.

#### Airport Lounge Access

- 8 complimentary domestic airport lounge access per year
- Maximum Cap: 2 per quarter
- Available only for primary card holder

#### Fuel Surcharge Waiver

- 1% fuel surcharge waiver
- Minimum transaction: Rs. 400
- Maximum waiver: Rs. 250 per statement cycle

#### Other Benefits

- Exclusive discounts on dining via [Good Food Trail Dining program](https://v1.hdfcbank.com/htdocs/common/Good-Food-Trail/index.html)
- Attractive merchant offers

### Drawbacks

Though HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card ticks almost all check boxes as entry level card, there are some drawback too.

- Limited airport lounge access: HDFC Bank should have extended the airport lounge access to add-on card members too, instead of just restricting to primary card. Also absence of international airport lounge access is another downside.
- No SmartBuy 10X Rewards Program: HDFC Bank has excluded the HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card from their legendary [10X Rewards Program](/hdfc-smartbuy-10x-rewards-even-more-rewarding-with-december-2019-update/). This is an utter disappointment and I wish HDFC Bank should have extended 10X Rewards Program to this credit card too.

### Verdict

5% cashback on PayZapp & SmartBuy and 2.5% cashback on all online spends is really lucrative. The default reward rate of 1% is also decent and puts this card in race with recently launched co-branded credit cards like [Amazon Pay ICICI](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/) and [Flipkart Axis](/flipkart-axis-bank-credit-card-review-and-hands-on-experience/). HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card is an ideal first credit card for beginners and I would recommend it highly.
