Just like [last year](/amex-2x-reward-points-on-educational-spends/), American Express (Amex) has launched the 2X rewards offer on education spends this year too. Under this offer, Amex is providing 2 Membership Reward Points for every Rs. 50 spent on education. Let's look in to the details of this offer.

### Bottomline

This is a decent offer from Amex and will surely help you earn extra reward points. The stark difference between last year's and this year's promotion is there was no maximum cap last year. However there is a maximum cap of 5,000 reward points which I feel is little low. You should be able to hit the maximum cap by spending Rs. 1.25 Lakhs.
