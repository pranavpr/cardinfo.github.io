Amazon in collaboration with ICICI Bank launched Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card in October 2018. This card makes your shopping on [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) more rewarding by providing a reward rate of up to 5% if you are a Amazon Prime member.

### Eligibility Criteria

At this point of time, this card is invite only. I'm not sure what algorithm [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) uses for invites. However a healthy relationship with ICICI bank and an existing credit card from ICICI certainly increases the chance for invitation.

You can check the eligibility by visiting [this](https://www.amazon.in/cbcc/marketpage) page. If eligible, you can apply for the card by providing details of your existing ICICI Credit Card. If everything goes smooth, you would be issued a digital version of the card instantly. The physical card would be delivered to your mailing address within 7 working days. The credit limit of this card would be equal to your existing ICICI credit card.

### Fees

There is no joining or renewal fee for this card and this card is issued life time free.

### Rewards

The different reward rates for this card are outlined below:

- **5%** for Amazon Prime customers at [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon)
- **3%** for non-prime customers at [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon)
- **2%** on digitally fulfilled categories and physical gift cards
- **2%** on paying through Amazon Pay at Amazon Pay partner merchants
- **1%** on all other spends

The best part about this card is absence of upper cap on rewards. The rewards are credited as Amazon Pay balance in [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) account each month after statement generation.

### Features

Given that it's Amazon co-branded card, it's features are pretty much limited to shopping on [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon). Below are few of them:

- No cost EMI of 3 or 6 months on [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon)
- Surcharge waiver of 1% on fuel transactions
- 15% discount when dining at restaurants participating in [Culinary Treats](https://www.icicibank.com/offers/brands/culinary-treats.page)

### Drawbacks

Given that this card has no joining and renewal fee, I don't have great expectations from it. However I would still like to highlight some drawbacks as below:

- No way to redeem rewards for statement credit
- No rewards on fuel transactions
- No rewards for purchasing gold and EMI transactions at [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon)
- Amazon Prime membership (Rs. 999 annually) required for maximum benefit
- No clarity on eligibility/invitation criteria

### Verdict

5% cash-back on [Amazon](https://l.cardinfo.in/amazon) and 1% elsewhere is really a good offer and no other card in this segment provides equivalent benefits. This is the sole reason that this card features in my list of [best credit cards in India for 2019](/best-credit-cards-of-2019-in-india/). The simple and seamless integration of rewards with Amazon Pay is another highlight. If you are invited for this card, don't give a second thought and go for it.
