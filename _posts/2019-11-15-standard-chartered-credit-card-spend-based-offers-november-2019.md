### Bottomline

I received this offer on [Standard Chartered Manhattan Credit Card](/standard-chartered-manhattan-credit-card-review/) which I am not using actively. For me, the spend target is Rs. 39,700 for a cashback of Rs. 1,000. This translates to an incremental reward rate of 2.5% which is quit decent.

Currently Standard Chartered is also running [festive offer](/sc-festive-19-offer-1-unlimited-cashback-on-standard-chartered-credit-cards/) wherein it's providing 1% unlimited cashback on credit cards. If both offers stack, then incremental reward rate shoots to 3.5% which is quite awesome. However in T&C of this offer, Standard Chartered has mentioned that this offer can't be clubbed with any other offer, and hence I can't confirm the double-dip.

_Let me know the spend target and casback amount you received on your Standard Chartered Credit Card in comments below._
