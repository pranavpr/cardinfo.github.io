### Bottomline

This is nice offer wherein HDFC Bank Infinia and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) credit card holders can enjoy a reward rate of whooping 14.4% (after deducting 2% + GST foreign currency markup) on spends of Rs. 30,000. For HDFC Bank [Regalia](/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) and Diners ClubMiles, the reward rate is 4.14% which is still decent. And in case of these cards, the maximum spend should be limited to Rs. 137,500 during offer period. However, I wish, HDFC Bank should have rolled out this offer to all card members instead of chosen ones. Inclusion of other countries apart from USA would have been a nice addition.
