HDFC Bank, in a pleasant surprise, has enabled the [OYO Rooms on SmartBuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/oyo-room-stay) portal today. The older option to book hotels on SmartBuy portal is powered by [Cleartrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/cleartrip) and it indeed lists the [OYO](https://l.cardinfo.in/oyo) hotels. But this option also includes all other hotels too. With this new addition, budget conscious travelers can exclusively search among [OYO](https://l.cardinfo.in/oyo) hotels without getting distracted by other options.

HDFC Bank has also extended the SmartBuy 10X program till end of this month. Hence HDFC Bank Credit Card holders can now enjoy 10X rewards on [OYO](https://l.cardinfo.in/oyo) too. Let's look in to the benefits and different partners of 10X Program in detail.

### Bottomline

Addition of [OYO Rooms](https://l.cardinfo.in/oyo) on SmartBuy portal is a welcome move by HDFC Bank. In October 2019 only, they have enabled [Gyfter on SmartBuy](/10x-rewards-on-gift-vouchers-using-hdfc-bank-credit-cards/) platform. This clearly shows that HDFC Bank is quite serious about SmartBuy program and I speculate that many more brands would be added under soon.

Below table summarizes the reward rate of some popular HDFC Bank credit cards with 10X Program.
