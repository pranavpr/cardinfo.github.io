Once you fill up the form, you will be contacted by their executive for fixing an appointment. Their executive will visit your place to scan the documents using their mobile app. Hence you need to keep the original documents with yourself during the appointment. Once document collection is done, executive will handover you the card kit which contains following:

- NiYO Global Card
- ATM Pin
- Welcome letter
- Most important terms and conditions

You should be able to login to NiYO Global app post KYC approval and card activation which happens same day in the night. Post that you can transfer funds to your card using Account Number and IFSC code displayed in the app.

### Verdict

This is a fantastic card which simplifies the forex transactions to a great extent. Given that company is not charging anything for this card, I don't see a reason for not using this card. Ability to transfer excess funds back to your bank account is cherry on the top.
