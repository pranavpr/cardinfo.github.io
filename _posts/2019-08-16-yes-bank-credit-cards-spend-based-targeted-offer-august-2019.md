Yes Bank is trying hard to retain their market share after they [devalued their credit cards](/yes-bank-credit-cards-rewards-reduced/) and after [May](/yes-bank-credit-card-spend-based-offers-may-2019/) & [June](/yes-bank-credit-card-spend-based-offer-june-2019/), they are back with another spend based targeted offer for August 2019.

This offer translates to a reward rate of 25% which is awesome, however the maximum cap. of Rs. 250 is little disappointing. I received this offer on my [Yes First Exclusive Credit Card](/yes-first-exclusive-credit-card-review/) which I have stopped using after reduction in reward rate and have transferred all my spends to [HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/). However Yes First Exclusive Credit Card is still a good card to hold and features in my list of [best credit cards in India for 2019](/best-credit-cards-of-2019-in-india/).

_Let me know in comments below if you received this offer on your Yes Bank credit card._
