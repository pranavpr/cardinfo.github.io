Flipkart in partnership with Axis Bank launched a co-branded credit card, [Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card](/flipkart-axis-bank-credit-card-review-and-hands-on-experience/), on 11th July 2019. This is the second attempt of both [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) and Axis Bank for a co-branded credit card. Their earlier attempt, Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card, has been a failure as this card never gained popularity due to low rewards and limited features.

### Rewards

[Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card](/flipkart-axis-bank-credit-card-review-and-hands-on-experience/) comes with unlimited cashback which would be credited to card account three days before statement generation. The cashback rate is multi-tiered based on merchants and is summarized below:

### Features

Below are some notable features of this card:

- 4 complementary Domestic Airport Lounge access per year using [Mastercard India Lounge Program](https://specials.priceless.com/en-in/offers/Mastercard_India_Lounge_Program?Oid=201902180040)
- 1% fuel surcharge waiver on transactions between Rs. 400 and Rs. 4000
- 20% off at restaurants participating in [Dining Delights](https://diningdelights.axisbank.com/) program

Airport lounge access on this entry level card is certainly a welcome move.

### Fees & Welcome Benefits

Surprisingly there is no mention of waiver of renewal fee on meeting annual spend criteria like other cards. Below are the joining and renewal fee for this card:

- Joining Fee: Rs. 500
- Renewal Fee: Rs. 500

The joining fee is compensated by Rs. 500 [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) voucher which they are offering if a transaction is made on card within 30 days of issuance. They are also offering welcome promo codes for Gaana, [Goibibo](https://l.cardinfo.in/goibibo), [Makemytrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/makemytrip), [Myntra](https://l.cardinfo.in/myntra) and Urban Clap.

### Eligibility

The eligibility criteria for this credit card is very generic on Axis Bank website. However based on my conversation with their representative, below is the eligibility criteria for this card:

- Age should be between 18 to 70 years
- Salaried: Net Monthly income > Rs. 25,000
- Self Employed: Net Monthly income > Rs. 50,000 or ITR > Rs. 6 Lakhs

### How to apply?

Currently, there is no streamlined online application process for this card. You can request a call back for this credit card by clicking the button below:

<a href="https://www.axisbank.com/retail/cards/credit-card/flipkart-axis-bank" target="_blank" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger btn-block post-element mt-2" rel="noopener"><i class="ci-pen"></i> Request Callback</a>

They will call you back within 2 hours and ask your salary details to confirm the eligibility of this card. Afterwards they will send their executive to collect the KYC documents. The process is mostly offline and I wish they would have made it as seamless as [Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/).

### Bottomline

I feel this is a decent entry level card from [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) & Axis Bank. Default reward rate of 1.5% is better than [Amazon](/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-review/), [Ola](/ola-in-association-with-sbi-card-launches-ola-money-sbi-credit-card/) and [Paytm](/paytm-launches-paytm-first-credit-card-in-india/) co-branded credit cards. The domestic lounge access is cherry on top which none of the cards in this segment provide. It's a no brainer to go for this card if you're a frequent shopper on [Flipkart](https://l.cardinfo.in/flipkart) and [Myntra](https://l.cardinfo.in/myntra).
