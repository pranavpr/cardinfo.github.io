ICICI Bank has rolled out a spends based offer on their debit cards wherein they are providing Amazon vouchers on meeting the spend criteria. ICICI Bank rolls out offers on debit cards more frequently than credit cards, which is quite surprising. Last quarter too, ICICI Bank rolled out [Triple Delights Offer](/icici-triple-delights-offer-10-cashback-on-debit-cards/). And they are back again this quarter with another offer on their debit card. Let's look into the details of this new offer.

### Bottomline

I received the offer on my ICICI Bank debit card wherein I have to spend Rs. 81,000 across the required categories to get Amazon voucher worth Rs. 300. This translates to a reward rate of 0.37% which is quite low. I wish ICICI Bank should have provided a better reward rate to make this offer attractive. For now, I have decided to skip this offer and continue using my [Diners Club Black Credit Card](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/) which will provide me a reward rate of 8.1% utilizing latest [spends based offer](/hdfc-bank-credit-cards-spends-based-offer-march-2020/).
