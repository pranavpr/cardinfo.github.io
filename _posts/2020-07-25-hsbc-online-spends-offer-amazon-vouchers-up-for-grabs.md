This seems to be a decent offer with a reward rate varying between 2.5% to 3.33%. I received a target of Rs. 15,000 for Rs. 500 Amazon voucher on my HSBC Visa Platinum Card. I registered for the offer as mentioned in the email and I got the following reply.

I am definitely going to utilize this offer as reward rate is almost equivalent to my [HDFC Infinia](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} and [Diners Club Black](/hdfc-diners-club-black-credit-card-review/){:target="\_blank"} credit cards which are my primary drivers.
