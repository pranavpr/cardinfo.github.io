RBL Bank is trying aggressively to capture the credit card market these days. This is quite evident from multiple spend based targeted offers they are running this month. I was made aware of two spend based offers wherein RBL Bank is providing gift vouchers on meeting the spend criteria.

### Bottomline

Both these offers are decent offers and one should definitely try to use these if they received communication from RBL Bank. However, I feel, if RBL Bank really wants to increase it's market share for Credit Cards, it should focus on improving reward rates on existing credit cards. Their recent launch, [RBL Bank Practo Plus Credit Card](/rbl-bank-practo-plus-credit-card-launched/) is really unattractive in terms of rewards. If they are really serious about credit card market, they should learn from their peers and launch flat cashback credit cards, instead of focusing on targeted offers.

_Let me know in comments below if you received targeted offer on credit card from RBL Bank._
