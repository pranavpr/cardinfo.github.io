### Bottomline

The is a fantastic move by HDFC Bank and the new offerings make Diners Club Black Credit Card even better. The monthly milestone benefits pushes the reward rate even higher.

However, one thing is clear, HDFC Bank is trying to convert all existing life time free card members to paid ones. Also there is no mention of 5,000 reward points one used to get on renewal. If this omission is not by mistake, then basically you are paying for those yearly memberships in form of annual fee for card. However, before jumping the gun, let's wait for more clarity and communication from HDFC Bank.
