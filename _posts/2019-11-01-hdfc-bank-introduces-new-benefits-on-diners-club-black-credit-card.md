### Design

{% include image.html image="hdfc-bank-diners-club-black-new-design.jpg" alt="HDFC Bank Diners Club Black Credit Card new design" class="cc-center mb-3" %}
First and foremost, HDFC Bank has refreshed the design of the card with a prominent marking of "Black" at the front. The new design is aesthetically pleasing to eyes and overall adds to the premium look of the card.

Also HDFC Bank has enabled contactless payments on this card which was not available earlier. This certainly adds to the convenience in paying for transactions less than Rs. 2,000.

### Annual Memberships

Following new memberships have been introduced with HDFC Bank Diners Club Black Credit Card:

- Club Marriott
- Forbes Digital subscription
- Zomato Gold
- Amazon Prime
- [MakeMyTrip](https://l.cardinfo.in/makemytrip) Double Black
- Times Prime

Above annual memberships are part of welcome benefits and can be availed upon completing the first transaction within the first 90 days from card open date for cards issued from 1st November 2019.

Existing HDFC Bank Diners Club Black customers can avail complimentary annual membership benefits by:

- Achieving annual spend milestone of Rs. 8 Lakhs at the time of card anniversary on their existing Diners Black card

or they can avail the complimentary annual membership benefits **immediately** by:

- Upgrading to a new HDFC Bank Diners Club Black Credit Card with joining/renewal fees of Rs. 5000/-. The upgrade can be done via NetBanking or PhoneBanking after 1st December 2019.
- Upon achieving a spend milestone of Rs. 2.50 Lakhs in the period Aug 2019 to Oct 2019 or Nov 2019 to Jan 2020. The card will be eligible for new Diners Club Black upgrade after 1st December 2019 under current pricing of existing card.

### Annual Benefits

Complimentary annual memberships from the above partners are provided to card members who achieve an annual spend milestone of Rs. 8 Lakhs at the time of Card Anniversary. Customers eligible for annual membership benefits will be communicated on HDFC Bank registered Mobile Number via SMS and Email ID within 30 days from the date of card anniversary.

Card members will continue to get renewal fee waiver on achieving a spend of Rs. 5 Lakhs in a year. However complimentary membership would be provided only after spending Rs. 8 Lakhs in a year.

### Monthly Benefits

Card members can select two of following vouchers on achieving a monthly spend of Rs. 80,000:

- Ola Select membership
- [BookMyShow](https://l.cardinfo.in/bookmyshow) voucher worth Rs. 500
- [TataCLiQ](https://l.cardinfo.in/tatacliq) voucher worth Rs. 500

Customers eligible for Monthly Milestone benefit will be communicated on HDFC bank registered Mobile Number via SMS and Email ID within the following month with instruction on how to avail it.

That's additional 1.25% reward rate in addition to 3.3% regular reward rate making overall reward rate of 4.55% which is simply amazing. This reward rate is even better than HDFC Bank's most premium card, [HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card](/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card-upgrade-experience/).

### Dining Benefits

- 2X rewards on weekend dining
- Minimum transaction: Rs. 150
- Maxcap on weekend dining reward points: 2,000

This an awesome benefit and pushes the reward rate to 6.6% similar to Infinia. However availability of 2X rewards only on weekends and maxcap of 2,000 is little disappointing.

### Bottomline

The is a fantastic move by HDFC Bank and the new offerings make Diners Club Black Credit Card even better. The monthly milestone benefits pushes the reward rate even higher.

However, one thing is clear, HDFC Bank is trying to convert all existing life time free card members to paid ones. Also there is no mention of 5,000 reward points one used to get on renewal. If this omission is not by mistake, then basically you are paying for those yearly memberships in form of annual fee for card. However, before jumping the gun, let's wait for more clarity and communication from HDFC Bank.
