Hi! I am Pranav, a credit card enthusiast who is nuts about maximizing the benefits of his cards. I currently hold 15 active cards and using them intelligently for minting rewards and benefits for last 12 years. I have been saving in tunes of lakhs every year using my cards efficiently and intelligently. I am passionate about making people aware about optimal usage of credit cards and helping them devise an optimal strategy to use their credit cards.

For living, I work for [Groupon](https://people.groupon.com/2019/pranav-prakash-manager-software-engineering-bangalore/) as engineering manager where I manage couple of teams which work on improving the customer support experience and streamlining deal factory pipeline. I completed my B. Tech. (Hons.) in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in 'IIT Kharagpur') in 2008. Since then I have been involved in designing and developing software applications from scratch. I [code](https://pranavprakash.net/) in many languages for work and for play. When I'm not coding or blogging, I take pictures ([Flickr](http://flickr.com/itzpranav "Pranav's Photo Stream")), read ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/pranavpr "Pranav's Goodreads Profile")) or cook.

I started this blog to share by views and experience about credit cards with the world so that they can benefit from it too. I intend to provide real and unbiased reviews about credit cards available in India and tips & tricks to maximize the benefits out of them. All views expressed on this website are personal.
