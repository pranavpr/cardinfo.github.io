Hi! I am Pranav, a full-stack developer, technology architect and engineering manager with over 11 years of experience in software design, development and deployment, presently working at [Groupon](https://people.groupon.com/india/), India.

I completed my B. Tech. (Hons.) in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in 'IIT Kharagpur'). I code in many languages for work and for play. When I'm not coding, I take pictures ([Flickr](http://flickr.com/itzpranav "Pranav's Photo Stream")), read ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/pranavpr "Pranav's Goodreads Profile")), cook or explore new ideas about managing personal finance.
